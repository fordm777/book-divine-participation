Can you provide the quote from the Ante-Nicene father (i think tertullian) that wrote about head coverings and mentions how the arab culture even wore face coverings (what we call hijab now).  The father mentioned how the head covering was the norm for all churches and the Arab churches had the face covering
ChatGPT said:

Yes — the quote you’re thinking of does come from Tertullian’s On the Veiling of Virgins (De virginibus velandis, written c. 200 AD), where he appeals to contemporary customs to argue that Christian women should wear substantial veils. In chapter 17 he contrasts inadequate coverings used by some Christian women with the more complete covering of women in Arabia.

Here is the relevant passage in translation from the Ante-Nicene Fathers:

    “Arabia’s heathen females will be your judges, who cover not only the head, but the face also, so entirely, that they are content, with one eye free, to enjoy rather half the light than to prostitute the entire face… A female would rather see than be seen.”

Tertullian uses this example of women in Arabia covering the face as well as the head — what later Muslim tradition would call a niqāb or ḥijāb — to shame Christian women who he felt were inadequately covered (e.g., with mere turbans, bands, or small coifs), even during prayer or church services.

He also insists that Christian head covering was widely practiced in other churches founded by apostles:

    “So, too, did the Corinthians themselves understand [Paul]… to this very day the Corinthians veil their virgins. What the apostles taught, the disciples of the apostles confirmed.”

In this work, Tertullian is appealing to both apostolic custom and contemporary cultural examples to argue that women’s head covering was the normative practice in early churches and that Christian women ought to observe it properly.

If you’d like, I can provide the original Latin text of the passage as well.

It seems that Christians today are pushing to help woman (in particular from Arab places) to stop wearing head coverings.   This seems backwards.   Are there any other quotes from Ante-Nicene period discussing the importance of wearing head coverings while praying and prophecying
ChatGPT said:

Yes — beyond Tertullian, several Ante-Nicene Fathers and other early Christian writers clearly taught that women should wear head coverings (veils) when praying and prophesying and viewed this as a normative Christian practice rooted in Scripture (especially 1 Corinthians 11) rather than mere local custom. Here are some specific quotes and attestations from early sources:
📜 Key Early Christian Quotes on Head Coverings
1. Tertullian (c. 160–215 AD)

In On the Veiling of Virgins he strongly insists Christian women ought to wear a true veil — not a tiny thread or token — when approaching prayer or worship:

    “How severe a chastisement will they deserve, who amid the recital of the Psalms, and at any mention of the name of God, continue uncovered… even when about to spend time in prayer itself… and suppose themselves to be covered?”
    — Tertullian, On the Veiling of Virgins

He also records how the Corinthian churches still understood Paul to mean a real veil, not just long hair:

    “…the Corinthians veil their virgins… What the apostles taught, the disciples of the apostles approve.”
    — Tertullian, On the Veiling of Virgins

And in another tract he refers to Paul’s command that women pray/prophecy covered even on account of angels (1 Cor 11:10), insisting all women do so, not just married ones:

    “Every woman… even the virgin… is bidden to be veiled… it is because of the angels…”
    — Tertullian quoting Paul’s teaching (paraphrase)

2. Clement of Alexandria (c. 150–215 AD)

Clement explicitly taught head and face covering as modest and proper attire, especially in prayer:

    “Let the woman observe this… Let her be entirely covered… nor will she invite another to fall into sin by uncovering her face… For this is the wish of the Word, since it is becoming for her to pray veiled.”
    — Clement of Alexandria

He also states:

    “It has also been enjoined that the head should be veiled and the face covered; for it is a wicked thing for beauty to be a snare to men.”
    — Clement of Alexandria

3. Irenaeus (c. 130–202 AD)

Commenting on Paul’s instruction in 1 Cor 11, Irenaeus translates that a woman ought to wear a veil on her head, “because of the angels.”

    “A woman ought to have a veil upon her head, because of the angel.”
    — Irenaeus, Against Heresies

4. Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170–235 AD)

In his Apostolic Tradition — an early liturgical manual — Hippolytus prescribes:

    “Let all the women have their heads covered with an opaque cloth, not with a veil of thin linen, for this is not a true covering.”
    — Hippolytus, Apostolic Tradition

He emphasizes women covering in worship and teaching as the expected practice in the Roman church of his day.
5. Shepherd of Hermas (c. ~90 AD)

Even in a very early Christian work, a visionary depicts a woman veiled as a symbol of purity and devotion.

    “A virgin… with white sandals… and veiled up to her forehead.”
    — Shepherd of Hermas

6. Apostolic Tradition / Didascalia Apostolorum

Other early texts attributed to apostolic practice also teach women should cover head and modestly veil themselves in public and in prayer.

    “And when you walk in the street, cover your head with your robe… Cover your face from strange men with a veil of modesty.”
    — Didascalia Apostolorum

🧾 Paul’s Own Teaching (1 Corinthians 11)

While not a “father” quote, this is the foundation the early Fathers repeatedly cite:

    “Every man… praying or prophesying, having his head covered dishonors his head. But every woman… with her head uncovered dishonors her head… let her be covered.”
    — 1 Corinthians 11:4–6 (Paul)

👀 Summary

Across the second and early third centuries:

    Universal church practice was that women covered their heads for prayer and worship.

Fathers like Clement, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus all taught that this practice had moral, theological, and spiritual significance and was not merely a local Greek or Roman custom.

Some writings even extend the covering beyond just the head to include the face or modest veil in public settings.
