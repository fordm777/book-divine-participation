One of the most difficult realities in modern Christian discourse is that believers often talk past one another—not because one side rejects Scripture, but because both sides are reading the same text through the same inherited framework, even when that framework itself is the point of tension.

This creates a peculiar and frustrating dynamic. One Christian may clearly see something in the biblical text—something about death, bondage, covenant, or participation—and yet find it impossible to explain why it matters. The other Christian, reading the same passage, genuinely cannot see the significance being pointed out. Both are sincere. Both appeal to Scripture. Both assume the disagreement is about emphasis or clarity.

In reality, the disagreement is often not about the text at all. It is about the **conceptual framework** being used to interpret it.

When a framework becomes invisible, it feels neutral. When it feels neutral, it feels inevitable. And when it feels inevitable, any reading that does not conform to it seems either mistaken or dangerous. As a result, Christians may sense that something important is being missed, yet lack the language to explain why—because the assumptions shaping their reading have never been named, examined, or questioned.

This book exists to make those assumptions visible.

It does not assume that Christians disagree because one group is careless with Scripture and another is faithful. Rather, it assumes that many disagreements persist because shared frameworks quietly filter what readers are able to see, hear, and consider plausible within the text. Until those frameworks are brought into the light, conversations will continue to circle without resolution.
