# Foreword

The question that prompted this book was not new. Christians have wrestled with it for centuries: *How does the cross save us?*

What was new—at least to me—was the realization that the question itself might be shaped by assumptions I had never examined. I had grown up hearing that Jesus took the punishment I deserved, that God's wrath was poured out on him in my place, and that salvation was a legal transaction completed on the cross. This framework felt so natural, so biblical, that I never thought to question whether Scripture itself required it.

But questions have a way of persisting, even when we try to silence them.

Why does the book of Hebrews speak so extensively about priesthood, sanctuary, and cleansing, yet never mention courtroom verdicts or transferred punishment? Why does the Day of Atonement in Leviticus 16 focus on the high priest entering the Most Holy Place with blood, rather than on the death of the animal outside? Why do the earliest Christian writers emphasize victory over death and participation in Christ's life, rather than legal substitution?

These questions did not arise from a desire to be different or controversial. They arose from reading Scripture carefully and noticing that the framework I had inherited did not always fit what the text was actually saying.

This book is the result of that slow, sometimes uncomfortable process of re-examination. It is not written to attack those who hold penal substitutionary atonement, nor to dismiss the sincerity of those who find comfort in it. It is written for those who, like me, have sensed that something important might be missing—or that something foreign might have been added—and who want to know what Scripture itself says when read on its own terms.

The central claim of this book is simple but far-reaching: **atonement, as Scripture defines it, is a priestly act accomplished in the sanctuary, not a legal transaction executed in a courtroom.** When that distinction is honored, much of the confusion surrounding modern debates about the cross begins to dissolve. Texts that seemed to support penal substitution reveal themselves to be speaking of something else entirely—participation, cleansing, victory, liberation—all of which are real, but none of which redefine what atonement is.

This book does not claim to be the final word on the subject. It does claim to be asking questions that deserve serious attention and offering answers grounded in Scripture's own categories rather than in later theological systems.

If you have ever wondered why debates about the atonement feel so intractable, or why sincere Christians reading the same Bible come to such different conclusions, this book may help. The problem is often not that one side is ignoring Scripture and the other is faithful to it. The problem is that both sides are reading Scripture through frameworks that have become invisible—and therefore unchallengeable.

This book attempts to make those frameworks visible, to examine them carefully, and to ask whether Scripture itself requires them. What emerges is not a narrower gospel, but a clearer one. Not a rejection of Christ's work, but a fuller understanding of it. Not a denial of what God has accomplished, but a recovery of how Scripture says he accomplished it.

The gospel is not diminished when we move from legal-forensic categories to priestly-participatory ones. If anything, it becomes more personal, more transformative, and more hopeful. Christ does not merely declare us righteous from a distance; he brings us through death into life. He does not simply absorb punishment in our place; he enters our condition in order to heal it from within. He does not leave us managing the old life with divine assistance; he gives us new life through participation in his death and resurrection.

This is the gospel as Scripture presents it. And it is better news than we dared imagine.

*This book is written for those who take Scripture seriously, who honor the early church, and who are willing to ask hard questions even when the answers require rethinking long-held assumptions. It is written with respect for those who disagree, with gratitude for those who have gone before, and with hope that clarity—not division—will be the result.*

# Introduction

One of the most difficult realities in modern Christian discourse is that believers often talk past one another—not because one side rejects Scripture, but because both sides are reading the same text through the same inherited framework, even when that framework itself is the point of tension.

This creates a peculiar and frustrating dynamic. One Christian may clearly see something in the biblical text—something about death, bondage, covenant, or participation—and yet find it impossible to explain why it matters. The other Christian, reading the same passage, genuinely cannot see the significance being pointed out. Both are sincere. Both appeal to Scripture. Both assume the disagreement is about emphasis or clarity.

In reality, the disagreement is often not about the text at all. It is about the **conceptual framework** being used to interpret it.

When a framework becomes invisible, it feels neutral. When it feels neutral, it feels inevitable. And when it feels inevitable, any reading that does not conform to it seems either mistaken or dangerous. As a result, Christians may sense that something important is being missed, yet lack the language to explain why, because the assumptions shaping their reading have never been named, examined, or questioned.

This book exists to make those assumptions visible.

It does not assume that Christians disagree because one group is careless with Scripture and another is faithful. Rather, it assumes that many disagreements persist because shared frameworks quietly filter what readers are able to see, hear, and consider plausible within the text. Until those frameworks are brought into the light, conversations will continue to circle without resolution.

## What This Book Does Differently

This book is not the first to question penal substitutionary atonement, nor is it the first to emphasize participation in Christ or the victory of the cross. Many thoughtful works have addressed these themes from various angles—historical, philosophical, and theological.

What makes this book different is not that it rejects one view and proposes another, but that it attempts to do something more foundational: **to restore the biblical categories within which atonement itself is defined, and then to read the rest of Scripture's testimony within that framework.**

Specifically, this book:

### 1. Begins with Ontology, Not Soteriology

Most discussions of the atonement begin with the question, *How are we saved?* This book begins earlier: *What is death? What is life? What does it mean to be human?* These ontological questions—questions about the nature of reality itself—shape everything that follows. If death is understood primarily as legal penalty, then salvation will be understood as legal acquittal. If death is understood as bondage, corruption, and exile from life, then salvation will be understood as liberation, cleansing, and restoration. The ontology determines the soteriology.

### 2. Restores the Levitical Cultic Framework

Modern theology often treats the sacrificial system as background information, useful for understanding metaphors but not determinative for understanding mechanism. This book argues that the Levitical cult—the system God himself established—provides the proper framework for understanding what atonement is. Atonement is not an abstract concept open to various interpretations. It is a defined priestly action involving blood, sanctuary, cleansing, and access. When that definition is honored, many modern debates dissolve.

### 3. Centers Hebrews as the Definitive Atonement Text

The book of Hebrews is often treated as one voice among many in discussions of the atonement. This book argues that Hebrews is not one voice among many—it is the New Testament's definitive exposition of how Christ's priestly work accomplishes salvation. Hebrews explicitly interprets the Levitical system, locates atonement in the heavenly sanctuary, and frames salvation in terms of cleansing, access, and mediated communion. When Hebrews is given its proper weight, the entire discussion shifts.

### 4. Distinguishes Atonement from Other Works of Christ

One of the most significant contributions of this book is its insistence that **not everything Christ accomplished should be labeled "atonement."** Modern theology often collapses victory over death, liberation of captives, resurrection life, moral transformation, and priestly cleansing into a single undifferentiated category called "atonement theories." This creates confusion and endless debates. Scripture does not speak this way. It describes many distinct works of Christ, each with its own grammar and purpose. Atonement is one of those works—a specific priestly act—not a catch-all term for salvation in general.

### 5. Systematically Engages the Strongest Biblical Texts for PSA

This book does not dismiss or avoid the passages most frequently cited in support of penal substitutionary atonement. It engages them directly and seriously: Isaiah 53, Galatians 3:13, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Romans 3-5, and others. But it reads them within the biblical categories already established—priestly, covenantal, participatory—rather than imposing a legal-forensic framework upon them. The claim is not that these texts are unclear, but that they are often read through assumptions Scripture itself does not require.

### 6. Traces the Historical Development of Legal Frameworks

Understanding how we arrived at our current frameworks is essential for evaluating them. This book traces the historical development of legal-forensic categories in Western theology, showing how metaphors gradually became mechanisms, and how participatory language was increasingly replaced by transactional language. This is not done to attack tradition, but to show that what feels inevitable is actually contingent—the result of specific historical developments, not the only way Scripture can be read.

### 7. Addresses the Semantic Shift in Key Theological Terms

Words change meaning over time, and theological terms are no exception. "Wrath," "propitiation," "atonement," and "justice" do not mean the same things in modern English that they meant in Hebrew, Greek, or even early English translations. This semantic drift has quietly reshaped how we read Scripture. This book brings that shift into the open, showing how recovering the original meanings of these terms changes the entire discussion.

### 8. Integrates All of This into a Unified Biblical-Theological Argument

Most books do one or two of these things. Some critique penal substitution. Some emphasize participation. Some discuss Hebrews. Some engage the early church. This book attempts to integrate all of these elements into a single, coherent argument that moves from ontology through biblical theology, historical development, and careful exegesis, culminating in a clear and compelling alternative to the legal-forensic framework.

## What This Book Is Not

This book is not an attack on those who hold penal substitutionary atonement. It is not written to mock, dismiss, or caricature sincere believers who have found comfort in that framework. Many who hold PSA do so with deep reverence for Scripture and genuine concern for God's justice and holiness.

This book is also not claiming to have discovered something entirely new. The participatory, priestly understanding of salvation presented here is deeply rooted in the biblical text and was the dominant framework of the early church for centuries. What is new is not the content, but the need to recover and articulate it clearly in a context where legal-forensic categories have become so dominant that they feel inevitable.

Finally, this book is not claiming to answer every question or resolve every tension. Theology is the church's ongoing conversation about God's self-revelation in Scripture. This book is a contribution to that conversation, not the final word.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is written for thoughtful Christians who:

- Sense that something important might be missing from the way they have been taught to understand the cross
- Want to engage Scripture seriously, not merely defend inherited traditions
- Are willing to ask hard questions even when the answers require rethinking long-held assumptions
- Desire clarity without division, and truth without arrogance
- Long for a gospel that is not only legally sound but personally transformative

It is written for those who take the early church seriously, who honor the witness of the Ante-Nicene fathers, and who believe that Scripture itself—not later theological systems—should determine how we understand salvation.

It is written for pastors, students, and laypeople who find themselves in conversations where everyone is appealing to the same Bible but no one seems to be speaking the same language.

And it is written for anyone who has ever wondered: *Is there more to the gospel than I've been told?*

## How to Read This Book

This book is structured to build progressively. Each part lays groundwork for what follows.

**Part I** establishes the ontology—what life, death, and humanity actually are according to Scripture. This is foundational. If you skip this, the rest will not make sense.

**Parts II-III** examine the Passover and the sacrificial system, showing how deliverance and atonement actually work in the biblical narrative.

**Part IV** addresses covenant, particularly the question of whether the new covenant is truly new or merely renewed, and what that means for understanding salvation.

**Part V** explores participation in Christ, showing how salvation is entered rather than merely explained.

**Part VI** describes what life looks like after death's dominion is broken.

**Part VII** addresses the hermeneutical issue: how language drift has reshaped theology without most people noticing.

**Part VIII** traces the historical development of legal frameworks and how they came to replace participatory ones.

**Part IX** engages the strongest biblical arguments for opposing views, showing that the texts themselves do not require the frameworks often imposed upon them.

**Part X** concludes by bringing everything together.

Each part is necessary. Skipping ahead may create confusion, because later arguments depend on earlier foundations.

## A Final Word Before We Begin

If you have held penal substitutionary atonement for years, this book will challenge you. That is not its goal, but it is likely its effect. I ask only that you read carefully, consider the arguments on their own terms, and test everything against Scripture.

If you have long sensed that something was wrong with PSA but lacked the language to articulate why, this book may provide the clarity you have been seeking.

If you are somewhere in between—uncertain, questioning, or simply curious—this book invites you into a conversation that has been ongoing for two thousand years and remains vital today.

The gospel is not fragile. It does not collapse when examined carefully. What collapses, sometimes, are the frameworks we have built around it—frameworks that, however well-intentioned, may obscure as much as they reveal.

This book is an attempt to remove some of that obscurity, to let Scripture speak in its own categories, and to recover a vision of salvation that is both ancient and urgently needed.

The cross is not less glorious when understood rightly. It is more so.

Let us begin.
