# Divine Participation Book (Markdown)

## Structure

- `toc.md`: Table of Contents (Parts + Chapter titles)
- `part-XX/chapter-YY.md`: Chapter drafts
- `appendices/`: Appendix material
  - `index.md`: Index of theological concepts, terms, and themes
  - `scripture-references.md`: Comprehensive list of all scripture references with links to chapters
  - `ancient-writers.md`: Extended contextual excerpts from ancient Christian writers (Ante-Nicene Fathers, etc.) to provide full context and avoid proof-texting

## Conventions

- Parts are numbered: `part-01`, `part-02`, ...
- Chapters are numbered: `chapter-01.md`, `chapter-02.md`, ...

## Notes

**Chapter 7 (removed):** Concepts from "Propitiation, Atonement, and Hijacked Words" should be incorporated into:
- Chapter 5 (The Blood That Speaks) — propitiation/atonement language
- Chapter 6 (Covenant Cleanness) — how words were hijacked
- Chapter 4 (What Sacrifices Were) — foundational context

**Index:** Consider creating an index for key theological concepts, terms, and themes (e.g., propitiation, atonement, participation, substitution, etc.)
