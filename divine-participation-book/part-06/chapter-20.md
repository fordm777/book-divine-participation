# Chapter 20 — From One Lord to Another: Renunciation and Allegiance

## Salvation as Transfer, Not Mere Decision

If salvation is a passage from one dominion to another, then it necessarily involves more than inward belief. It requires the severing of one allegiance and the taking up of another. Scripture consistently presents salvation not as a private conviction, but as a public transfer of lordship.

This is why the earliest Christians did not treat baptism as an optional symbol appended to faith. They understood it as the **decisive moment of renunciation and re-allegiance**, enacted in the body and confessed with the mouth.

What modern theology often fragments into separate ideas—faith, repentance, confession, baptism—the early church held together as a single, coherent act of transfer.

## Renunciation Before Confession

In the earliest Christian practice, baptism was preceded by an explicit renunciation of former masters. This was not dramatic excess or superstition. It was the logical consequence of believing that humanity exists under real dominions.

To renounce Satan was to renounce false gods, the power of death, the dominion of sin, and the authority of the accuser. Only after this renunciation was allegiance to Christ confessed.

This pattern appears clearly in early Christian catechesis.

### Hippolytus of Rome  
*(early 3rd century)*

In *The Apostolic Tradition*, Hippolytus describes the baptismal rite used in Rome:

> “When he who is to be baptized goes down into the water, let him who baptizes lay hand on him, saying thus: ‘Dost thou renounce Satan, and all his service, and all his works?’  
> And when he has said, ‘I renounce him,’ let him baptize him once.  
> And again he shall say, ‘Dost thou believe in Christ Jesus, the Son of God…?’”

Renunciation comes first. Confession follows. Baptism enacts the transfer.

This sequence was not regional or idiosyncratic. It reflects how early Christians understood **what salvation is**.

## Calling on a New Name

Scripture speaks of salvation as calling upon the name of the Lord. The early church understood this not as a mental act alone, but as a **public invocation of a new Lord** in the act of baptism.

To call on the name of Jesus was to declare Him as the new ruler and master of one’s life.

### Justin Martyr  
*(mid-2nd century)*

Justin describes Christian baptism to a pagan audience:

> “As many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are instructed to pray and entreat God with fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them.  
> Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated…  
> For in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water.”

Notice the logic: belief, repentance, prayer, and then invocation of the name in baptism. The name is not a formula. It is a declaration of lordship.

## Baptism as the Moment of Transfer

For the early church, baptism was not a mere testimony of something already completed. It was the **moment when the old life was abandoned and the new life entered**.

This is why baptism was consistently linked with forgiveness, deliverance, new birth, and reception of the Spirit.

### Tertullian  
*(late 2nd–early 3rd century)*

Tertullian writes plainly:

> “We are not washed in order that we may cease sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed already. For the first baptism of a learner is this: repentance.”

And elsewhere:

> “When we are going to enter the water, but a little before, in the presence of the congregation and under the hand of the bishop, we solemnly profess that we renounce the devil, and his pomp, and his angels.”

For Tertullian, baptism is not magic, but it is **decisive**. It is the embodied point where repentance and allegiance take form.

## Confession and New Allegiance

Confession in the early church was not reduced to a private prayer. It was a public declaration of loyalty.

To confess “Jesus is Lord” was to declare that Caesar was not, the demons were not, and death was not.

### Cyril of Jerusalem  
*(4th century)*

Cyril instructs catechumens preparing for baptism:

> “First you enter the vestibule of the baptistery, and there you face the west and are told to stretch forth your hand, and as in the presence of Satan you renounce him.  
> Then you are told to say, ‘I renounce thee, Satan, and all thy works, and all thy pomp, and all thy service.’  
>  
> Then you turn from the west to the east, the place of light, and say, ‘I believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Spirit.’”

The physical movement itself preaches the theology: west to east, darkness to light, old lord to new.

## One Master Replaced by Another: The Apostolic Logic

What the early church practiced did not arise in a vacuum. It reflects the logic of Scripture itself, especially the apostolic teaching concerning lordship, service, and dominion.

Paul is explicit that salvation involves a change of masters, not merely a change of status.

> *“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”*  
> (Romans 6:16)

For Paul, obedience is not a generic moral category. It reveals **ownership**. To obey is to serve, and to serve is to belong.

He continues:

> *“But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.  
> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.”*  
> (Romans 6:17–18)

Freedom, in Paul’s language, does not mean independence. It means **transfer**. One servitude ends. Another begins.

This is why Paul does not describe the Christian life as managing sin while forgiven. He describes it as having **died** to one master and come alive to another.

> *“For he that is dead is freed from sin.”*  
> (Romans 6:7)

Death ends claims. Death ends jurisdiction. Death ends ownership.

Romans 7 reinforces this same logic through covenant imagery. Paul compares the law’s claim to a marriage bond that only death can dissolve.

> *“Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead.”*  
> (Romans 7:4)

Here again, the solution is not modification or improvement. It is **death**, followed by a new belonging.

---

## No Shared Allegiance

Jesus Himself speaks in precisely these terms.

> *“No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.”*  
> (Matthew 6:24)

This is not a warning about divided attention. It is a statement about **incompatible lordship**. Service implies exclusivity. Allegiance cannot be shared between competing rulers.

This is why Jesus never presents salvation as partial liberation. One master must be displaced for another to rule.

---

## The House Must Change Ownership

Jesus’ teaching on deliverance follows the same logic.

When accused of casting out demons by demonic power, Jesus responds:

> *“How can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.”*  
> (Matthew 12:29)

Deliverance is not negotiation. It is conquest. The strong man must be bound, and his claim must be broken.

Later, Jesus warns of what happens when this logic is ignored:

> *“When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest…  
> Then he saith, I will return into **my house** from whence I came out…  
> And the last state of that man is worse than the first.”*  
> (Matthew 12:43–45)

Jesus’ language is precise. The spirit refers to the person as “my house.” The problem is not that the house was swept. The problem is that its ownership was never decisively transferred. Jesus does not describe the spirit as trespassing, rather he describes it as returning to what it still considers its own.

Removal without replacement leaves jurisdiction unresolved. A house that is merely cleared but not re-claimed remains vulnerable to return, because no new lord has taken possession.

This is why deliverance alone is never presented in Scripture as sufficient. Authority must change hands. Ownership must be broken and reestablished. The house must not only be emptied, but claimed.

This is precisely why the early church insisted on renunciation, confession, and baptism together. They understood that freedom requires more than expulsion. It requires transfer of lordship.

## Scripture and Practice Speak with One Voice

Romans teaches that death ends mastery.  
Jesus teaches that service cannot be shared.  
The early church enacted this reality through renunciation, allegiance, and baptism.

These are not competing accounts. They are the same truth expressed through doctrine, teaching, and embodied practice.

Salvation is not the suppression of one master while another waits politely.  
It is the replacement of one lord with another.

This is why deliverance is not merely release, but **reassignment**.  
Why baptism is not merely symbolic, but **decisive**.  
And why confession is not merely verbal, but **allegiant**.

Only where dominion has changed can freedom be sustained.

---

## Not a Ritual, but a Reality

The early church did not believe that exact wording or ritual precision saved a person. They did believe that **salvation involved real transfer**, and that this transfer had to be enacted, confessed, and embodied.

Renunciation without allegiance was incomplete.  
Allegiance without renunciation was incoherent.  
Baptism without faith was meaningless.  
Faith without passage was unfinished.

What held these together was not sacramental anxiety, but **ontological realism**. They believed dominions were real, and so was liberation.

---

## Why This Matters for What Follows

If salvation is fundamentally a transfer of lordship, then many modern attempts at deliverance begin in the wrong place. One cannot cast out an authority that still rules by right. One cannot maintain freedom without first changing allegiance.

This is why the earliest Christians did not treat renunciation, confession, and baptism as optional steps. They understood them as **the means by which deliverance was established**, not merely expressed.

Only after dominion had been broken did spiritual warfare take its proper form—not as escape, but as resistance.

That distinction will matter greatly in what follows.
