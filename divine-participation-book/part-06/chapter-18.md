# Chapter 18 — Deliverance Without Death: Why Freedom Often Fails to Hold

## Real Authority, Real Effects, Real Limits

The New Testament leaves no doubt that the authority of Christ is real and effective against the powers of darkness. Jesus casts out demons. The apostles cast out demons. Scripture does not present this authority as symbolic or psychological, but as genuine and operative.

A striking example appears in Acts, when Paul commands a spirit to leave a woman who had followed him persistently:

> *“I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.”*  
> (Acts 16:18)

The spirit obeys immediately.

This matters. It establishes that demonic influence can be restrained or expelled by the authority of Christ, even when the deeper question of dominion has not yet been resolved. Authority can be exercised *over* a person or situation without yet changing who owns it.

For this reason, it would be inaccurate and unfair to dismiss modern deliverance ministries as imaginary or ineffective. Many people experience genuine relief. Some experience clarity, peace, and real interruption of torment. Something real is often happening.

And yet, something essential is often missing.

## The Pattern of Relief and Return

A troubling pattern repeats itself across many deliverance contexts.

People seek freedom from oppression, fear, compulsions, or recurring sin. Prayer is offered. Spirits are confronted. Confession is made. Renunciations are spoken. Ties are broken. Relief follows. Testimonies are shared.

And then, often, the struggle returns.

Sometimes the same behaviors reappear—sexual immorality, drunkenness, rage, despair. Sometimes the person feels worse than before. They are told they need deeper deliverance, further renunciation, more prayer, or additional sessions.

This cycle is exhausting.

And it raises an unavoidable question:  
**If Christ’s authority is real, why does freedom so often fail to hold?**

## Binding Is Not the Same as Transfer

Part of the confusion arises from failing to distinguish between **restraint** and **dispossession**.

Scripture shows that demonic powers recognize authority. They can be silenced, bound, or driven back by the name of Christ. This explains why binding spirits during prayer or gospel proclamation can have real effects. Resistance weakens. Deception loosens. The person may feel immediate relief.

But restraint is not the same thing as a change of ownership.

Authority can be exercised *over* a domain without transferring who that domain belongs to. This is why Jesus warns that an unclean spirit can leave a person and still regard them as *“my house.”*

> *“I will return into my house from whence I came out.”*  
> (Matthew 12:44)

The spirit does not describe itself as trespassing. It describes itself as returning to what it still considers its own.

Removal without transfer leaves jurisdiction unresolved.

## Confession, Renunciation, and Breaking Ties — Necessary but Not Sufficient

Many deliverance ministries rightly emphasize confession, renunciation, and the breaking of ties with past sins, practices, curses, and allegiances. These actions are not meaningless. Scripture consistently affirms the power of confession to bring darkness into the light and weaken accusation.

Such practices can dismantle specific footholds. They can interrupt patterns of deception and shame. They can bring real, measurable relief.

However, confession alone does not change dominion.

Repentance turns the heart.  
Renunciation names what must be left behind.  
But **death transfers ownership**.

Without death in Christ, the underlying structure remains intact. The house may be swept. Agreements may be revoked. Access points may be closed. Yet the land itself remains under the same authority.

This is the distinction that is often missed.

---

## Sin as Master, Not Merely Spirits as Influences

Paul’s analysis in Romans exposes the deeper issue.

He does not locate humanity’s primary bondage in spirits. He locates it in **Sin as a reigning power**.

> *“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”*  
> (Romans 6:16)

For Paul, obedience reveals ownership. Sin is not merely an act. It is a **master**.

This becomes unmistakable in Romans 7:

> *“For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing…  
> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.”*  
> (Romans 7:18, 20)

Paul is not excusing sin. He is diagnosing **power**.

The struggle he describes is not primarily demonic possession. It is enslavement to a ruling power operating through the flesh. This is why people can sincerely renounce behaviors and still return to them. The governing power has not been displaced.

Deliverance alone cannot solve Romans 7.

## Paul’s Pastoral Warning: Returning to Sin After Transfer

Paul’s letters make clear that death with Christ does not eliminate the possibility of returning to sinful patterns. But he is equally clear that such return is not normal, expected, or harmless.

In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul expresses concern that some within the church have already begun to drift back into former practices:

> *“Lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.”*  
> (2 Corinthians 12:21)

Paul is not addressing unbelievers.  
He is not describing people who were never transferred.  
He is speaking to members of the church.

This matters.

Their sin does not mean death and transfer never occurred. But it does mean that **defilement has returned**, and with it renewed vulnerability to accusation and spiritual exploitation.

Paul’s concern is not framed in terms of lost justification. It is framed in terms of **uncleanness**, lack of repentance, and disrupted fellowship. His language is covenantal and temple-oriented, not forensic.

## Return Is Possible — But Not Neutral

Paul’s warning shows that post-transfer sin is possible, but it is not neutral.

Returning to practices like sexual immorality and impurity does not restore the old master as rightful owner. But it **reopens space** within the life of someone who now belongs to Christ.

This aligns precisely with Paul’s other warnings:

> *“Neither give place to the devil.”*  
> (Ephesians 4:27)

The danger is not that sin reclaims lawful dominion.  
The danger is that sin **gives ground** to an enemy who has already been disarmed.

This is why repentance and cleansing remain necessary—not to reestablish deliverance, but to restore order, clarity, and fellowship within a life that has already changed ownership.

---

## Why This Strengthens the Argument, Not Weakens It

Paul’s warnings in 2 Corinthians do not contradict death-and-transfer theology. They presuppose it.

Only someone who has been transferred can meaningfully be said to:
- defile what has been made holy,
- disrupt fellowship rather than lose identity,
- give place rather than obey as a slave.

If sin still ruled by right, Paul’s warnings would be unnecessary.  
If sin were inevitable, his grief would be incoherent.

Instead, Paul assumes freedom—and warns against misusing it.

---

## Dominion Broken, Responsibility Restored

Death with Christ breaks dominion.  
Resurrection life restores responsibility.

Paul’s pastoral concern is not that believers are still enslaved, but that they are **failing to live in alignment with the freedom they have received**.

This is why he weeps.  
This is why he warns.  
This is why he calls for repentance.

Not because ownership is uncertain,  
but because holiness matters where God now dwells.

---
## Why People Return to sin

When people “cut ties” but remain under the dominion of sin and death, relapse is not mysterious. It is expected.

Paul explains why:

> *“For he that is dead is freed from sin.”*  
> (Romans 6:7)

Freedom from mastery comes through death, not intention. Until death has occurred, sin remains a ruling power, even if its activity is temporarily restrained by prayer or authority.

This is why deliverance can be real yet incomplete. Spirits may be forced to leave, but sin continues to reign. The behaviors return because the master has not been removed and then the person gives the spirits legal right to return.

Spirits exploit that dominion.  
They are not its source.

---

## Baptism as the Decisive Act of Transfer

The early church did not attempt deliverance without baptism, nor baptism without renunciation. They understood baptism as the moment when death occurred, allegiance shifted, and ownership changed.

> *“Buried with him in baptism… wherein also ye are risen with him through faith.”*  
> (Colossians 2:12)

This is not about ritual precision or sacramental anxiety. It is about **ontological reality**.

Without death, deliverance remains provisional.  
Without transfer, authority remains contested.  
Without baptismal participation, the old claim persists.

A person must pass out of one realm and into another.

---

## Deliverance and the Trap of Needs-Based Christianity

When deliverance is separated from death and transfer, it can unintentionally become another form of needs-based Christianity.

The focus shifts from belonging to Christ to managing symptoms. Freedom becomes episodic rather than decisive. Prayer becomes a mechanism for relief rather than communion. Spiritual life becomes reactive rather than grounded.

People are repeatedly treated as though they are free while still living under the same authority they are trying to escape.

They fight as tenants trying to evict an owner they still legally live under.  
That is exhausting.

## What This Chapter Has Shown

Deliverance ministries often address real problems with real authority. But when death, transfer, and new lordship are not established first, freedom cannot be sustained.

Scripture does not present deliverance as the doorway into Christ.  
It presents deliverance as what follows **after** the doorway has been passed through.

The doorway has a name.  
It has a shape.  
And it has always involved death.

The next chapter will turn to what life looks like **after** deliverance has been properly grounded—how believers stand, resist, repent, and walk faithfully without confusion about who rules.

Freedom is not rewon.  
It is lived.
