# Chapter 19 — Living Free from Death’s Dominion

## Freedom That Must Be Lived, Not Rewon

If death’s dominion has truly been broken, and if allegiance has genuinely been transferred, then the Christian life cannot be described as an ongoing attempt to get free. Freedom is not the goal toward which believers strive. It is the ground on which they now stand.

This is precisely the posture assumed in Paul’s exhortation in Ephesians 6. When Paul turns to the subject of spiritual conflict, he does not instruct believers to fight their way out of bondage. He addresses those who are already free and calls them to remain so.

> *“Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.”*  
> (Ephesians 6:10)

The struggle Paul describes does not arise because dominion remains intact, but because opposition persists after dominion has been broken. For this reason, the repeated command is not to advance, escape, or overthrow, but to **stand**.

> *“Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”*  
> (Ephesians 6:11)

Paul does not frame the believer’s posture as one of desperate pursuit of freedom. He assumes a position already secured and urges believers to hold it. This is why the language intensifies:

> *“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”*  
> (Ephesians 6:13)

The sequence matters. One does not stand *in order to become free*. One stands **because freedom has already been accomplished**. The armor of God is not given to those still under the dominion of Satan, but to those who have already been transferred into the kingdom of Christ. It is not designed to liberate captives, but to stabilize those who are already free.

At the same time, Scripture is clear that resurrection life must be lived. Salvation is not fragile or reversible, but neither is it passive. Life in Christ is real life—one that must be walked in, guarded, and nourished amid ongoing opposition.

This chapter, therefore, addresses what freedom looks like after deliverance has occurred, and why repentance, cleansing, and vigilance remain essential without undermining the reality of death, transfer, and new dominion.

## Dominion Broken Does Not Mean Struggle Removed

The early Christian claim was not that a delivered person could never sin again. It was that sin no longer ruled as master. Dominion had changed. Authority had been transferred. The old lord had been displaced.

This distinction matters. Temptation can persist without ownership. Pressure can remain without dominion. Conflict can exist without slavery.

When believers sin after deliverance, they are not returning to their former lord as rightful owner. They are yielding ground to an enemy who has already been disarmed. The failure is real, but the relationship has changed.

This is why the New Testament speaks seriously about sin after salvation without treating it as a collapse back into bondage by default.

## Satan After Transfer: Accuser, Not Owner

Scripture consistently identifies Satan as *the accuser*. The name itself points to his function. He is not primarily portrayed as a ruler acting by right, but as an adversary who brings charges, presses claims, and seeks to undermine confidence before God.

Once a person has been transferred from the power of darkness into the kingdom of God’s Son, Satan’s strategy changes. Ownership has been lost. Jurisdiction has been stripped. What remains is opposition through accusation.

He cannot rule by authority, but he can harass through accusation. He cannot reclaim ownership, but he can attempt to destabilize fellowship, provoke fear, and draw believers into hiding or despair.

This is why Scripture calls him *“the accuser of the brethren.”* Accusation is no longer a verdict; it is an attempt to erode confidence and faithfulness in those who already belong to God.

## Cleansing, Not Re-Deliverance

This is where covenant logic becomes essential.

In Scripture, sin after deliverance does not automatically undo belonging, but it does defile what has been made holy. Under the old covenant, Israel did not cease to be God’s people every time they sinned. Yet sin disrupted fellowship, polluted the sanctuary, and required cleansing so that God’s presence could continue among them.

Ezekiel’s vision makes this clear. He is shown idols set up *inside* the temple—within the very space where God’s presence was meant to dwell. The issue was not loss of covenant identity, but defilement of God’s dwelling. Cleansing was required, not re-adoption.

The same pattern governs the Christian life.

Repentance and cleansing are not about re-crossing from death to life. They are about restoring alignment, communion, and clarity where sin has introduced disorder. They remove the ground on which accusation stands.

## Walking in the Light: 1 John and Covenant Cleansing

This is precisely the concern of 1 John.

John does not write to people trying to escape dominion. He writes to those who already belong to God and exhorts them to *walk in the light*. His concern is not ownership, but fellowship.

> *“If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”*

Cleansing here is covenantal, not forensic. It restores fellowship, not dominion. Forgiveness addresses the disruption of relationship, not the reestablishment of salvation.

John assumes transfer has already occurred. What he guards against is the corrosive power of accusation when sin is hidden, denied, or rationalized.

## Why Confession Silences Accusation

Accusation thrives in darkness. It gains leverage where sin is concealed, rationalized, or carried alone in the conscience. This is why confession is not a threat to freedom, but one of its primary protections.

When sin is brought into the light, accusation loses its ground. The enemy’s role as accuser collapses when there is nothing left to accuse with. Cleansing restores confidence, not by pretending sin does not matter, but by addressing it truthfully within the security of belonging.

This is precisely the logic assumed by James when he exhorts believers:

> *“Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.”*  
> (James 5:16)

James does not speak to people trying to escape dominion. He speaks to those already within the community of faith. Confession here is not a means of reentering covenant, but a means of healing what sin has disrupted within it. The goal is restoration, not re-adoption.

Confession breaks isolation. It exposes accusation to the light. It restores alignment between conscience, community, and truth. Where sin is confessed, accusation cannot rule.

Repentance, therefore, is not opposed to assurance. It is one of the means by which assurance is preserved—not by denying failure, but by refusing to let failure fester in secrecy.

## Deliverance Without Death, and Death Without Vigilance

Much modern confusion arises from mixing categories that Scripture carefully keeps distinct.

Some fight for freedom they have not yet entered. Others neglect vigilance after freedom has been given. Both errors arise from misunderstanding what actually establishes ownership and authority.

Deliverance without death produces cycles of relief and return, because the underlying dominion has never been displaced. Death without vigilance, however, produces avoidable defilement and unnecessary accusation, because what has been made God’s dwelling must still be kept aligned with its new Lord.

Jesus’ warning about an unclean spirit leaving and returning is not a lesson about temporary cleanliness, but about occupancy and rule. A house that is merely emptied but not truly reoccupied remains vulnerable, because authority has not changed. Removal without new ownership is unstable.

Scripture consistently treats a “house” as something that belongs to its builder and ruler.

> *“For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.”*  
> (Hebrews 3:4)

Where ownership has not changed, eviction efforts become endless. Where ownership has changed, vigilance becomes meaningful. The apostles, therefore, do not urge believers to fight for a new house, but to stand firm in the one they already belong to.

This is why the New Testament emphasizes standing after deliverance has been accomplished rather than repeated attempts to escape bondage.

And this is why so many believers today are exhausted.

They fight as tenants trying to evict an owner they still legally live under.  
That is exhausting.

## Life After Transfer

To live free from death’s dominion is not to live without vigilance. It is to live without confusion about who rules. The Christian life is not a repeated escape from bondage, but a faithful walk within a new kingdom.

Prayer is no longer a mechanism for containing the old self.  
It is communion with the new Lord.

Obedience is no longer an attempt to secure standing.  
It is the expression of a new allegiance.

Repentance is no longer panic over lost salvation.  
It is the honest restoration of fellowship.

Death has been passed through.  
Dominion has been broken.  
Accusation has been answered.

What remains is not deliverance to be rewon, but life to be lived.
