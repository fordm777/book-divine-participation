# Chapter 23 — Living Free from Death’s Dominion

## When Letting Go Feels Like Loss

If letting go of what belongs to darkness produces fear, resentment, or grief, Scripture would not interpret that as maturity being challenged. It would interpret it as **allegiance being exposed**.

Not because the person is evil,  
but because **dominion shapes desire**.

Jesus names this principle plainly:

> *“Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”*  
> (Matthew 6:21)

What we cling to reveals who has been forming us.

Fear does not arise because God is harsh. It arises because **another lord has been providing comfort, identity, stimulation, or control**. When those “toys” are threatened, the flesh reacts the same way any dependent system reacts when its supply is interrupted.

That reaction tells the truth.

It does not mean the person is hopeless.  
It means the person is **still entangled**.

This is not about moral superiority. It is about honesty.

The claim is not, “Good Christians don’t struggle to let go.”  
The claim is, “Struggle reveals where death has not yet been fully embraced.”

Paul says the same thing without embarrassment:

> *“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey…?”*  
> (Romans 6:16)

Yielding forms attachment.  
Attachment forms desire.  
Desire reveals dominion.

Resentment toward God over holiness almost always arises where a **penal framework** is mixed with **unbroken dominion**.

The penal framework says: *God is taking something from me.*  
Unbroken dominion says: *I need this to live.*

Together they produce bitterness.

Once death has occurred, the same command feels different. What once felt like loss begins to feel like relief.

## Freedom That Must Be Lived, Not Rewon

If death’s dominion has truly been broken, and if allegiance has genuinely been transferred, then the Christian life cannot be described as an ongoing attempt to get free. Freedom is not the goal toward which believers strive. It is the ground on which they now stand.

This is precisely the posture assumed in Paul’s exhortation in Ephesians 6. When Paul turns to the subject of spiritual conflict, he does not instruct believers to fight their way out of bondage. He addresses those who are already free and calls them to remain so.

> *“Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.”*  
> (Ephesians 6:10)

The struggle Paul describes does not arise because dominion remains intact, but because opposition persists after dominion has been broken. For this reason, the repeated command is not to advance, escape, or overthrow, but to **stand**.

> *“Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”*  
> (Ephesians 6:11)

Paul does not frame the believer’s posture as one of desperate pursuit of freedom. He assumes a position already secured and urges believers to hold it.

> *“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”*  
> (Ephesians 6:13)

One does not stand *in order to become free*.  
One stands **because freedom has already been accomplished**.

The armor of God is not given to those still under the dominion of Satan, but to those who have already been transferred into the kingdom of Christ. It is not designed to liberate captives, but to stabilize those who are already free.

At the same time, Scripture is clear that resurrection life must be lived. Salvation is not fragile or reversible, but neither is it passive. Life in Christ is real life—one that must be walked in, guarded, and nourished amid ongoing opposition.

## Dominion Broken Does Not Mean Struggle Removed

The early Christian claim was not that a delivered person could never sin again. It was that sin no longer ruled as master. Dominion had changed. Authority had been transferred. The old lord had been displaced.

This distinction matters.

Temptation can persist without ownership.  
Pressure can remain without dominion.  
Conflict can exist without slavery.

When believers sin after deliverance, they are not returning to their former lord as rightful owner. They are yielding ground to an enemy who has already been disarmed. The failure is real, but the relationship has changed.

This is why the New Testament speaks seriously about sin after salvation without treating it as a collapse back into bondage by default.

## Satan After Transfer: Accuser, Not Owner

Scripture consistently identifies Satan as *the accuser*. The name itself points to his function. He is not primarily portrayed as a ruler acting by right, but as an adversary who brings charges, presses claims, and seeks to undermine confidence before God.

Once a person has been transferred from the power of darkness into the kingdom of God’s Son, Satan’s strategy changes. Ownership has been lost. Jurisdiction has been stripped. What remains is opposition through accusation.

He cannot rule by authority, but he can harass through accusation.  
He cannot reclaim ownership, but he can attempt to destabilize fellowship, provoke fear, and draw believers into hiding or despair.

This is why Scripture calls him *“the accuser of the brethren.”* Accusation is no longer a verdict; it is an attempt to erode confidence and faithfulness in those who already belong to God.

## A House, a Former Tenant, and the Question of Standing

There was a man who owned a house.

The deed was in his name.  
The former tenant had been lawfully removed.  
The locks had been changed.  
Ownership was no longer in question.

Yet the owner, out of carelessness rather than malice, allowed traces of the former tenant to remain.

Old furniture was kept in the spare room.  
Mail still arrived under the former name.  
A spare key was never reclaimed.  
The owner continued to use some of the tenant’s old habits because they felt familiar.

When conflict later arose, the former tenant did not claim ownership.  
He claimed **standing**.

He pointed to the furniture.  
He pointed to the mail.  
He pointed to the key.

The question before the judge was not, “Who owns the house?”  
The question was, “Why does the former tenant still have access?”

Only after hearing the story does the truth become clear:

The problem was not ownership.  
The problem was what had been allowed to remain.

This is how Scripture speaks about life after deliverance.

In Christ, ownership has changed.  
Death has occurred.  
The former lord has no rightful claim.

But access can still be granted.

Not because the enemy has authority,  
but because standing has been tolerated.

This is why Scripture warns believers not to “give place” to the devil.  
Not because he owns the house,  
but because he exploits what is left behind.


Scripture often explains spiritual realities through domestic imagery.

A house belongs to its builder and ruler.

> *“For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.”*  
> (Hebrews 3:4)

Jesus’ warning about an unclean spirit returning is not about temporary cleanliness, but about **occupancy and rule**.

> *“I will return into my house from whence I came out.”*  
> (Matthew 12:44)

The spirit does not speak as a trespasser.  
It speaks as one who still claims standing.

The problem is not that the house was swept.  
The problem is that ownership was never decisively settled.

Removal without transfer leaves jurisdiction unresolved.

This is why vigilance feels like fear only within a penal framework.

If God is imagined primarily as an angry judge, then removing what belongs to darkness feels like appeasement.

But if God is understood as the rightful owner who **dwells** in the house, then removing those belongings is not penal. It is relational.

The image is closer to marriage than to a courtroom.

A wife who fills her home with reminders of former lovers—photographs, letters, mementos—may insist that she has chosen her husband. Yet those objects quietly contradict her confession. The husband’s grief is not legal outrage. It is relational betrayal.

The issue is not punishment.  
The issue is **fidelity**.

Scripture repeatedly uses this language when describing Israel’s unfaithfulness. Through Jeremiah, God speaks not as a judge tallying violations, but as a wounded spouse:

> *“Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me.”*  
> (Jeremiah 3:20)

Judah’s sin is not framed merely as lawbreaking. It is framed as *whoredom*—a divided heart that continues to welcome former lovers while claiming a new covenant.

In this light, holiness is not about avoiding penalty.  
It is about honoring presence.

Removing what belongs to the old life is not fear-driven obedience.  
It is the natural act of faithfulness when a new relationship has truly begun.


The issue is not earning ownership.  
The issue is refusing access.

## Cleansing, Not Re-Deliverance

This is where covenant logic becomes essential.

In Scripture, sin after deliverance does not automatically undo belonging, but it does defile what has been made holy. Under the old covenant, Israel did not cease to be God’s people every time they sinned. Yet sin disrupted fellowship, polluted the sanctuary, and required cleansing so that God’s presence could continue among them.

Ezekiel’s vision makes this clear. He is shown idols set up *inside* the temple—within the very space where God’s presence was meant to dwell. The issue was not loss of covenant identity, but defilement of God’s dwelling.

Cleansing was required, not re-adoption.

The same pattern governs the Christian life.

Repentance and cleansing are not about re-crossing from death to life. They are about restoring alignment, communion, and clarity where sin has introduced disorder. They remove the ground on which accusation stands.

## Walking in the Light: 1 John and Covenant Cleansing

This is precisely the concern of 1 John.

John does not write to people trying to escape dominion. He writes to those who already belong to God and exhorts them to *walk in the light*. His concern is not ownership, but fellowship.

> *“If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”*

Cleansing here is covenantal, not forensic. It restores fellowship, not dominion. Forgiveness addresses the disruption of relationship, not the reestablishment of salvation.

John assumes transfer has already occurred. What he guards against is the corrosive power of accusation when sin is hidden, denied, or rationalized.

## Why Confession Silences Accusation

Accusation thrives in darkness. It gains leverage where sin is concealed, rationalized, or carried alone in the conscience.

This is why confession is not a threat to freedom, but one of its primary protections.

> *“Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.”*  
> (James 5:16)

James does not speak to people trying to escape dominion. He speaks to those already within the community of faith. Confession here is not a means of reentering covenant, but a means of healing what sin has disrupted within it.

Confession breaks isolation.  
It exposes accusation to the light.  
It restores alignment between conscience, community, and truth.

Where sin is confessed, accusation cannot rule.

---

## Deliverance Without Death, and Death Without Vigilance

Much modern confusion arises from mixing categories that Scripture carefully keeps distinct.

Some fight for freedom they have not yet entered.  
Others neglect vigilance after freedom has been given.

Deliverance without death produces cycles of relief and return, because the underlying dominion has never been displaced. Death without vigilance produces avoidable defilement and unnecessary accusation, because what has been made God’s dwelling must still be kept aligned with its new Lord.

Where ownership has not changed, eviction efforts become endless.  
Where ownership has changed, vigilance becomes meaningful.

This is why the apostles urge believers to **stand**, not to escape again.

And this is why so many believers today are exhausted.

They fight as tenants trying to evict an owner they still legally live under.  
That is exhausting.

---

## Life After Transfer

To live free from death’s dominion is not to live without vigilance. It is to live without confusion about who rules.

Prayer is no longer a mechanism for containing the old self.  
It is communion with the new Lord.

Obedience is no longer an attempt to secure standing.  
It is the expression of a new allegiance.

Repentance is no longer panic over lost salvation.  
It is the honest restoration of fellowship.

Death has been passed through.  
Dominion has been broken.  
Accusation has been answered.

What remains is not deliverance to be rewon,  
but life to be lived.
