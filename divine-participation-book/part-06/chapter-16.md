# Chapter 16 — Delivered Through Death: What Was Actually Broken

## Introduction: Deliverance, Not Management

## A Framework Difference, Not a Disagreement Over Effort

The tension described here does not arise from carelessness or lack of devotion. It arises from two different frameworks used to understand what salvation is and how it works.

Within a **legal or forensic framework**, salvation is primarily understood as a verdict. Guilt is removed, status is changed, and acceptance before God is secured. Deliverance from sin’s power is then treated as a subsequent process, pursued through effort, discipline, and spiritual struggle.

Within an **ontological and participatory framework**, salvation is understood as death and rebirth. The problem being addressed is dominion rather than guilt, because death ends the jurisdiction under which guilt exercised its claim. The solution is not merely a declaration, but an enacted passage out of one realm and into another through participation in Christ’s death and resurrection.

Because these frameworks ask different questions, they generate different expectations. In a verdict-based framework, it is coherent to speak of someone as forgiven while still governed by the same powers, since the verdict has already been rendered. In a participatory framework, this category does not exist. If the governing power remains intact, then the passage out of that dominion has not yet occurred.

This difference explains why modern Christianity can proclaim forgiveness as complete while treating freedom from bondage as an ongoing struggle. It is not because deliverance is denied, but because deliverance has been relocated from the decisive moment of salvation to the ongoing experience of the Christian life.

Colossians 2 does not speak from within the verdict framework. It speaks in terms of death, burial, disarmament, and transfer. The record that granted authority was removed. The powers that exercised that authority were stripped. The old body was put off. All of this is described as the action of God, not the outcome of human effort.

What is at stake, then, is not whether forgiveness is real, but whether salvation is understood primarily as a declaration about us or as a passage we are brought through in Christ.


The New Testament does not describe deliverance as gradual relief from an ongoing captor. It describes deliverance as **a dominion being broken**, a claim being cancelled, and a power being disarmed. What follows is not escape, but resistance. Not therapy, but faithfulness.

Few passages make this clearer than Colossians 2.

## The Record That Stood Against Us

Paul writes that God forgave believers by addressing something specific and concrete:

> *“Having blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.”*  
> (Colossians 2:14)

This “handwriting” is not merely a list of moral failures. It is a **record of accusation**, a written claim that stood against humanity. In Paul’s thought, accusation is never abstract. Accusation establishes **jurisdiction**. It grants authority to those who wield it.

As long as accusation stands, dominion stands.

Forgiveness, therefore, is not simply God deciding to overlook guilt. It is God **removing the basis by which authority was exercised**.

The record of accusation establishes jurisdiction.
The record was not ignored.  
It was taken out of the way.  
It was nailed to the cross through death, not because justice was ignored, but because the realm in which the record had authority ceased to exist.

## Disarmed, Not Appeased

Paul immediately connects the removal of accusation to the defeat of hostile powers:

> *“And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.”*  
> (Colossians 2:15)

The rulers and authorities are not negotiated with. They are **disarmed**. Their weapon was accusation. Their claim was grounded in death. When the record is removed, their authority collapses.

This is not psychological relief.  
It is **cosmic displacement**.

Deliverance occurs not because the powers relent, but because they lose the ground on which they stood.

## The Operation of God, Not Human Effort

Paul then makes a striking clarification. This deliverance is not accomplished by human resolve, ritual precision, or inner striving. It is accomplished by **God’s own action**:

> *“In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.”*  
> (Colossians 2:11–12)

Here Paul names what actually effects the transition:  
**the operation of God**.

Deliverance is not self-generated.  
It is not maintained by effort.  
It is not achieved by technique.

God acts.  
The old body is put off.  
Burial occurs.  
Resurrection follows.

Faith is not contrasted with this action. Faith is the means by which one **entrusts oneself to it**.

---

## Burial Comes Before Standing

Paul is careful with sequence.

Before there is standing, there is burial.  
Before there is resistance, there is death.  
Before there is warfare, there is deliverance.

This is why the New Testament never instructs believers to fight in order to become free. It instructs them to stand **because freedom has already been accomplished**.

The dominion of death is not weakened by effort.  
It is ended by death itself.

## Why “Forgiven but Unchanged” Is Not a Biblical Category

If accusation has been removed, and if the powers have been disarmed, then ongoing dominion cannot be explained as normal Christian life. To speak of someone as forgiven while remaining governed by the same master is to separate forgiveness from deliverance.

Scripture does not do this.

Forgiveness is the announcement that the claim is gone.  
Deliverance is the consequence that rule has ended.

Where dominion remains intact, forgiveness has been reduced to abstraction.

## What This Chapter Has Established

Colossians 2 does not describe salvation as internal improvement or moral management. It describes an **objective rupture**:

- a record removed,
- powers disarmed,
- death enacted,
- burial completed,
- resurrection begun,
- all by the operation of God.

This raises a necessary question, which the next chapter must address:

**If dominion has been broken, when and how does a person actually pass out from under the old lord and into the new?**

The earliest Christians answered that question very clearly.

And they did not answer it with metaphor.
