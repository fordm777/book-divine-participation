## Covenant Release: Romans 7

Paul reinforces this in covenant terms.

> “Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another.”
> (Romans 7:4)

Death ends a covenant bond.

The law’s claim ends not because it was ignored, but because death dissolved the relationship.

Again, death precedes release.

The judge does not invent freedom.
He acknowledges that death has severed jurisdiction.

---

## What Reckoning Actually Means

The Greek word Paul uses, *logizomai*, means to count, to account, to regard as true.

It does not mean to fabricate.

Reckoning assumes an event has occurred.

Just as a death certificate records a real death, Paul calls believers to live in light of a real execution:

The old man has died.

The former master has lost jurisdiction.

The certificate of slavery is no longer valid.

This is not psychological affirmation.
It is ontological recognition.

---

## Death and Justification

Romans 6:7 is decisive:

> “He that is dead is justified from sin.”

Death ends the claim.

Justification is not the engine.
Death is.

This does not minimize justification. It clarifies its place.

God’s declaration corresponds to what has occurred through union with Christ.

He declares freedom because death has severed mastery.

---

## From Fiction to Freedom

If death is symbolic, then freedom must be maintained through effort.

If death is real, then freedom is foundational.

Paul does not tell believers to fight in order to become dead.
He tells them to reckon death and therefore live differently.

The command rests on accomplished reality.

This is why he can say:

> “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body.”
> (Romans 6:12)

Sin no longer reigns by right. It can only reign if invited.

---

## What This Chapter Establishes

Reckoning is not pretending.

It is acknowledging participation in Christ’s death.

Death has occurred.
Dominion has ended.
Jurisdiction has been severed.

Therefore live accordingly.

If death has not occurred, none of Paul’s exhortations make sense.

But if it has, then freedom is not fragile.

It is decisive.

And adoption is not sentimental.

It is relocation.

# Chapter 21 — Citizens of a New Kingdom

**(Behavior, Allegiance, and Representation)**

## From Death to Citizenship

Death with Christ is not an abstract event. It is an exit.

But exit is not the end.

Paul says:

> “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.”
> (Colossians 1:13)

Deliverance is relocation.

You are not merely freed.
You are transferred.

The language shifts from death to kingdom.

---

## Our Citizenship Is Elsewhere

Paul writes:

> “For our conversation [citizenship] is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour.”
> (Philippians 3:20)

The word translated “conversation” refers to citizenship.

Believers are not refugees without allegiance.
They are citizens of another realm.

This changes everything.

Behavior is no longer rule-keeping.
It is representation.

---

## Ambassadors, Not Assimilated Residents

Paul continues:

> “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ.”
> (2 Corinthians 5:20)

An ambassador lives in a foreign land but represents his own king.

He may adopt local language.
He may understand local customs.
He may even adapt culturally for the sake of persuasion.

But he does not abandon the directives of his sovereign.

If he does, he ceases to represent.

Jesus embodied this perfectly.

He ate with sinners.
He spoke their language.
He entered their homes.

But He did not adopt their lord.

---

## Resurrection Ethics

The teachings of Jesus make sense only here.

“Love your enemies.”
“Turn the other cheek.”
“Bless those who curse you.”

These commands are impossible under the dominion of death.

They assume resurrection life.

Paul echoes this in 1 Corinthians:

> “Why do ye not rather suffer wrong?”
> (1 Corinthians 6:7)

Only those who have passed through death can afford to lose.

Only those who no longer fear death can refuse retaliation.

---

## From Flesh to Spirit

Citizenship produces new behavior because life has changed.

> “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.”
> (Colossians 3:1)

Seeking above is not escapism.

It is alignment with your homeland.

Paul’s exhortations in Colossians and Ephesians are not legal demands. They are identity reminders.

Put off what belongs to the old realm.
Put on what belongs to the new.

Not to earn citizenship,
but because you have it.

---

## Freedom Does Not Mean Lawlessness

Paul anticipates misunderstanding.

> “All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient.”
> (1 Corinthians 6:12)

Citizenship does not eliminate responsibility.

It intensifies it.

Because your body is now a temple.
Because your life now represents a King.

Freedom is not autonomy.
It is alignment.

---

## Representation in the World

Jesus prayed:

> “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.”
> (John 17:16)

Not of does not mean removed from.

It means governed by another realm.

The citizen of the kingdom lives among those still under death’s dominion.

He speaks gently.
He forgives freely.
He refuses corruption.

Not because he fears punishment,
but because he serves another King.

---

## Behavior That Only Makes Sense After Death

The Sermon on the Mount is not entrance requirements.

It is resurrection living.

Under death’s dominion:

* Power protects itself.
* Violence answers violence.
* Reputation must be defended.

Under resurrection:

* Loss does not threaten identity.
* Death has already been faced.
* Vindication belongs to God.

These ethics only fit citizens of a new world.

---

## The Consistent Apostolic Pattern

Throughout Paul’s letters, the structure is identical:

1. Declare what God has done.
2. Declare who you now are.
3. Exhort behavior consistent with that reality.

Identity precedes instruction.

Citizenship precedes conduct.

Adoption precedes obedience.

---

## Why This Matters

If ethics are preached without death, they become legalism.

If death is preached without citizenship, freedom becomes chaos.

But if death is real and transfer is real, then ethics become natural.

You live as who you now are.

You represent the kingdom you belong to.

You act as one who has already passed through death and cannot be threatened by it again.

---

## What This Chapter Establishes

Resurrection life is not moral improvement.

It is political relocation.

You have died.
You have been raised.
You have been transferred.
You are a citizen of another kingdom.

Live like it.

Not to become one.
But because you already are.
