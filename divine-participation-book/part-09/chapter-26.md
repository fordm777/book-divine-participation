## Introduction

Penal substitutionary atonement (PSA) is the most prevalent understanding of the cross within modern evangelical Christianity and Protestant churches.

Within Reformed and Calvinist traditions, PSA is viewed as the Gospel itself. In broader evangelical contexts, the PSA framework is frequently adopted in practice, even when its theological structure is not fully articulated or understood. Phrases such as "Jesus took our punishment," "the wrath of God was poured out on Christ," and "the work of salvation was finished on the cross" are commonly used as summaries of the gospel itself and are rooted in the PSA framework.

Because of its widespread influence, penal substitutionary atonement deserves careful and serious engagement.

If PSA is to be questioned or rejected, it must not be dismissed casually or caricatured. Its defenders consistently appeal to Scripture, often with sincerity and deep concern for God's justice and the seriousness of sin. Many of the verses cited in support of penal substitution are not obscure or marginal. They are central texts that are familiar to many and repeatedly preached to promote the framework of PSA.

This chapter takes those passages seriously.

The claim of this book is not that these verses are ignored or evaded, but that **they are often read through a framework and set of definitions that Scripture itself does not require**. When those definitions and frameworks are re-examined—particularly in light of biblical ontology, Second Temple context, priestly categories, and the language of participation—many of the strongest proof texts for PSA no longer function as intended.

This is not a claim that PSA advocates are careless with Scripture. It is a claim that **the framework itself shapes what readers are able to see**. When that framework is brought into the light and examined, the texts themselves often speak more naturally of participation, cleansing, and deliverance than of legal substitution and retributive punishment.

## What Penal Substitutionary Atonement Claims

Penal substitutionary atonement is not merely the belief that Christ died "for us," or that his death was necessary for salvation. It is a specific theological framework with identifiable commitments, most clearly articulated within Reformed and Calvinist theology.

In its classical form, penal substitution teaches:

- **The primary problem salvation addresses is legal guilt before God.** Humanity stands condemned under divine law and requires judicial satisfaction.

- **God's justice is fundamentally retributive.** Sin must be punished; it cannot simply be forgiven without violating justice.

- **God's wrath is directed toward sinners as lawbreakers.** This wrath is judicial and awaits execution.

- **Christ acts as a legal substitute.** The guilt of sinners is imputed to Christ, who is treated as guilty in their place.

- **Christ is punished by the Father.** On the cross, Christ endures the penalty required by divine justice, satisfying wrath.

- **The cross is the site where atonement is completed.** Salvation is finished on earth at the moment punishment is executed.

- **Justification is a legal declaration.** Because the penalty is paid, believers are declared righteous through imputation.

Within this framework, legal metaphors are not illustrative but operative. Courtroom imagery is treated as the mechanism by which salvation works.

This chapter does not question the sincerity behind this doctrine. It does question whether Scripture itself constructs salvation in this way.

## The Location of Atonement: Earthly Shadows and Heavenly Reality

Before turning to individual passages, we must ask a foundational question: **where does atonement occur?** More specifically: **where does the atonement accomplished by Jesus Christ take place?**

Penal substitutionary atonement teaches that the decisive atoning act occurs on the cross, on earth, through punishment. The book of Hebrews presents a different, and more precise, location.

---

### Atonement in the Levitical System

Under the Mosaic covenant, atonement was not accomplished at the moment an animal died. Death was necessary, but **death itself was not the atoning act**.

Atonement occurred when the high priest:
- Entered the sanctuary  
- Carried the blood  
- Applied it within the holy place  
- Acted as mediator before God  

Death provided the blood. The priest's entry into the Most Holy Place with that blood accomplished the atonement. This distinction is not incidental—it is structural.

The animal's death was necessary, but it was not sufficient. What cleansed was not the death, but the **presentation of life** (carried in the blood) before God in the sanctuary.

This pattern is explained in detail in **Chapter 6: What Sacrifices Were (and Were Not)**, where the purpose and function of the Levitical offerings are examined carefully. The sacrificial system was never about punishment being transferred or wrath being appeased. It was about **cleansing that restores access** to God's presence.

---

### The Argument of Hebrews

The epistle to the Hebrews insists that the Levitical system was a **shadow**, not the reality. Earthly priests served copies of a heavenly reality, and Christ's priesthood belongs to that higher order.

Hebrews makes several structural claims that directly challenge a penal framework:

- Christ is not a priest on earth (Hebrews 8:4)  
- Earthly priests minister in shadows and copies (Hebrews 8:5)  
- Christ ministers in the **true heavenly sanctuary** (Hebrews 8:1-2)  
- Atonement occurs when Christ **enters** as high priest and presents his blood (Hebrews 9:11-12)

> "But if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law." (Hebrews 8:4)

This is not incidental. It is architectural.

Christ's death is necessary—it provides the blood and marks the end of the old order. But Hebrews specifically locates the atonement in the **heavenly tabernacle** where Christ entered and presented his blood as high priest before God.

---

### Death Enables; Priesthood Accomplishes

Hebrews never presents Christ's death as the isolated moment where justice is satisfied. Instead, death:
- Provides the blood  
- Ends the old covenant order  
- Enables entrance into the true sanctuary  

Atonement itself occurs in Christ's **living priestly ministry**, not in punishment executed at a moment in time on earth.

This is why Hebrews frames salvation in terms of:
- Cleansing (Hebrews 9:14)  
- Access (Hebrews 10:19-22)  
- Drawing near (Hebrews 7:19, 25)  
- Purified conscience (Hebrews 9:14; 10:22)  
- Mediated communion (Hebrews 8:6; 9:15)  

These are **priestly categories**, not judicial ones. They describe restoration of relationship through cleansing, not acquittal through punishment.

---

### "The Finished Work of Christ on the Cross"

At this point, a familiar phrase must be addressed: *"the finished work of Christ on the cross."*

This phrase has become so common in evangelical Christianity that many assume it is biblical language. It is not. It emerged within Reformed theology, particularly in the context of defending penal substitutionary atonement, and has since become embedded in Western Christian vocabulary.

Within a penal framework, this phrase means that atonement was completed on earth when punishment was executed and wrath was satisfied. But Scripture itself uses more careful language.

When Jesus declares, "It is finished" (John 19:30), the text does not say that priestly atonement was completed at that moment. What is finished is Christ's obedience, his self-offering, and his passage through death. The **work** is complete in the sense that nothing more needs to be added, no further sacrifice is required, and the old order has ended.

But Hebrews is explicit: Christ's saving work **moves through death into priestly action**. His death on the cross is not the end of his work—it is the means by which he enters the true sanctuary to accomplish atonement.

Completion is not denied—it is **located**.

Christ's work is finished in the sense that:
- No further sacrifice is needed (Hebrews 10:12)  
- Nothing remains to be added (Hebrews 10:14)  
- The old covenant order is ended (Hebrews 8:13)  

But it is finished **as priestly accomplishment**, not as penal execution.

Resurrection, ascension, and heavenly mediation are not appendices to salvation—they are integral to it. Paul makes this explicit: "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17). The cross without the resurrection would be the execution of a failed messiah. The resurrection is essential—not merely as proof that the cross worked, but as the **means by which we are justified and given life**.

Romans 4:25 states it clearly: "He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification." Romans 5:10 reinforces this: "For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!"

The biblical emphasis is on the **whole Christ-event**: incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, and ongoing intercession. To reduce this to "the finished work on the cross" is to narrow the focus in a way that Scripture itself does not.

---

### Why This Undermines Penal Substitution at Its Core

Penal substitutionary atonement requires that atonement be:
- Completed on earth  
- Executed through punishment  
- Resolved at the moment of death  

Hebrews explicitly denies this structure.

If Christ's priesthood is heavenly, and if atonement occurs through his entry into the true sanctuary, then:
- The cross is not a courtroom  
- The Father is not executing a sentence  
- Atonement cannot be reduced to punishment  

The cross is the means by which Christ **enters death**, so that, as risen high priest, he may carry humanity through death and into restored communion with God.

The following table summarizes the fundamental differences between these two frameworks:

Category	Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA)	Biblical Temple-Cleansing Atonement
Location of Atonement	On earth, at the cross, where punishment is executed and justice is satisfied	In the heavenly sanctuary through Christ's high-priestly mediation
Primary Problem Addressed	Legal guilt before God	Defilement, corruption, and death
Nature of Sin	Law-breaking requiring punishment	Polluting, corrupting power that brings death and exile
Role of Death	Penal punishment inflicted in place of sinners	Necessary passage into death in order to defeat it and remove corruption
Function of Blood	Evidence that punishment has been carried out	Cleansing agent that purifies persons and sacred space
Role of the Priest	Minimal or symbolic; focus is on execution of penalty	Central and essential; atonement is completed through priestly mediation
Sequence of Salvation	Death completes atonement; resurrection confirms it	Death enables atonement; resurrection and heavenly mediation accomplish it
Understanding of Wrath	Retributive anger requiring satisfaction	God's opposition to corruption and death, resolved through cleansing and restoration
Outcome of Atonement	Legal acquittal and imputed righteousness	Cleansed conscience, restored access, union with God, and new creation life
Controlling Metaphor	Courtroom and judicial verdict	Temple, cleansing, and purification
View of the Cross	Site where justice is satisfied	Necessary passage through death that leads to priestly mediation and victory
This is not a minor disagreement about emphasis. It is a fundamental difference in how salvation itself is understood.

## Isaiah 53 — "Smitten," "Stricken," and "Bruised"

Isaiah 53 is often treated as the clearest Old Testament statement of penal substitutionary atonement. For that reason, it deserves careful, unhurried attention. Rather than isolating phrases or assuming a framework in advance, it is best to hear the passage as a whole and then respond to its internal logic.

What follows begins with the text itself.

---

### Isaiah 53:4–7 (KJV)

> **Isaiah 53:4** — "Surely he hath borne our griefs,  
> and carried our sorrows:  
> yet we did esteem him stricken,  
> smitten of God, and afflicted.  
>  
> **Isaiah 53:5** — But he was wounded for our transgressions,  
> he was bruised for our iniquities:  
> the chastisement of our peace was upon him;  
> and with his stripes we are healed.  
>  
> **Isaiah 53:6** — All we like sheep have gone astray;  
> we have turned every one to his own way;  
> and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.  
>  
> **Isaiah 53:7** — He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,  
> yet he opened not his mouth:  
> he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,  
> and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb,  
> so he openeth not his mouth."

---

### A Confession of Misunderstanding (Isaiah 53:4)

The passage itself begins by identifying a **misinterpretation**:

> "Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted." (Isaiah 53:4)

This line does not explain what God was doing to the Servant. It explains what the observers *thought* God was doing. Isaiah frames this as a confession of misunderstanding, not as divine commentary.

The text then immediately corrects that assumption.

This matters. If the passage begins by naming a false interpretation, then we must be careful not to read the rest of the chapter through that same lens. The observers thought God was punishing the Servant. Isaiah says they were wrong.

---

### "Surely He Hath Borne Our Griefs" (Isaiah 53:4)

Isaiah defines the Servant's work before any mention of transgression or iniquity:

> "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows…" (Isaiah 53:4)

The language here is not judicial. It is **experiential and restorative**. Griefs, sorrows, sickness, and affliction are conditions to be carried and removed, not crimes to be punished.

This meaning is confirmed decisively by the Gospel of Matthew.

Matthew explicitly quotes this portion of Isaiah and tells us how it is fulfilled:

> "When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, **that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet**, saying,  
> *'He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.'*"  
> (Matthew 8:16–17)

Here, Isaiah 53 is fulfilled not at the cross, but in Jesus' **healing ministry**. Bearing griefs and sorrows means **entering human brokenness in order to remove it**.

This is not a secondary or metaphorical fulfillment. Matthew presents this as the direct fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy. The Servant bears sickness and grief by healing the sick and casting out demons—by confronting and removing the corruption that afflicts humanity.

---

### This Interpretation Comes *Before* the Cross (Matthew 8:16–17)

Isaiah 53 is often treated as a prophecy whose meaning is revealed only at the crucifixion, where it is assumed to describe penal punishment. Matthew explicitly contradicts that assumption by locating its fulfillment **before the cross**, in Jesus' public ministry of healing and deliverance.

This does not deny the cross. It **governs how the cross is understood**.

If Isaiah 53 already means:
- bearing sickness  
- carrying grief  
- removing corruption  

then it cannot later be redefined to mean:
- absorbing divine punishment  
- satisfying retributive justice  

Scripture does not permit such a shift in meaning. Matthew has already told us what "bearing our griefs" means. We cannot ignore that interpretation when we come to the cross.

---

### "Wounded for Our Transgressions" (Isaiah 53:5)

Isaiah then moves from sickness and sorrow to transgression and iniquity:

> "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities…" (Isaiah 53:5)

The preposition *for* does not demand penal substitution. It regularly denotes **purpose, result, or involvement**, not punishment. The Servant is wounded *because of* human sin—he enters into the consequences of sin—not *in order to receive punishment instead of sinners*.

The stated outcome is explicit:

> "With his stripes we are healed." (Isaiah 53:5)

**Healing**—not acquittal—is the stated result. This is consistent with what Matthew has already shown us. The Servant's work is restorative, not retributive.

---

### "The LORD Hath Laid on Him the Iniquity of Us All" (Isaiah 53:6)

This verse is often used as a summary statement of penal substitution:

> "And the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."  
> (Isaiah 53:6)

This verse is commonly read through a legal-penal framework and therefore understood to mean that guilt is **imputed** to the Servant so that he may be punished in place of the guilty. In this reading, "laid on him" is taken to describe a legal transfer of sin, whereby the Servant is treated as though he were guilty before God.

However, neither the temple framework of Leviticus nor the language of the Septuagint (LXX) supports such a reading.

---

#### The Levitical Context: Bearing Iniquity as Priestly Mediation

Leviticus explicitly states that the priest "bears the iniquity of the congregation" in order to make atonement (Leviticus 10:17), yet the priest is not punished. Bearing iniquity is presented as a **priestly act of mediation and removal**, not as the execution of retributive penalty.

This establishes the biblical category in which Isaiah is speaking. When Scripture speaks of bearing iniquity, it does not automatically mean receiving punishment. It means entering into the reality of sin in order to mediate its removal.

This immediately calls into question the assumption that bearing iniquity in Isaiah 53:6 implies imputed guilt or penal punishment.

---

#### The Septuagint: Exposure, Not Imputation

The Septuagint further clarifies the nature of this bearing. In Isaiah 53:6, the LXX uses the verb **ἐπέθηκεν** ("laid upon") together with the phrase **τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν πάντων** ("the sins of us all"), describing the LORD as causing the iniquity of all to **come upon** the Servant.

This language does not describe legal imputation. In the LXX, **ἐπιτίθημι** regularly denotes placing a burden upon someone, bringing something upon them, or causing them to encounter a condition. It is relational and experiential, not judicial.

No language of accounting, reckoning, condemnation, or sentencing appears. What is described is the **real arrival of sin's burden upon the Servant**, not a change in his moral or legal status before God.

This distinction is critical:
- **Imputation** concerns **status** (being legally counted as guilty)  
- Isaiah describes **exposure** (encountering the real effects of sin)

The Servant is never portrayed as guilty, sinful, or regarded by God as a transgressor. Instead, the iniquity of the people comes upon him in a concrete and devastating way. He enters into the full weight of Israel's corruption, exile, and death. Sin does not remain abstract or symbolic; it is **encountered**.

---

#### The Day of Atonement Pattern

For the Second Temple Jewish translators who produced the LXX, this wording would have naturally evoked priestly and cultic categories. Sin and impurity are realities that cling, contaminate, and destroy. To place them upon a representative figure is to expose that figure to the full force of what sin actually does—not so that punishment may be redirected, but so that the corruption itself may be confronted and dealt with.

This is where Levitical atonement imagery provides further clarity. On the Day of Atonement, sin is not assigned to a victim for punishment. It is **borne** so that it may be removed:

- The **scapegoat** bears iniquity away from the people (Leviticus 16:21-22)  
- The **priest** bears iniquity in order to make atonement (Leviticus 10:17)  

In neither case is bearing equated with retribution or imputed guilt. The scapegoat is not punished—it is sent away alive. The priest is not condemned—he mediates cleansing.

Isaiah 53:6 operates within this same conceptual world. To "lay" iniquity upon the Servant is not to punish him, but to place him fully within the human condition under sin—its corruption, its violence, its exile, and its death. The action is not penal, but **participatory**, as the Servant enters even death itself in order to confront, exhaust, and undo what sin produces.

---

#### Early Christian Interpretation

This understanding also reflects the trajectory of early Christian interpretation. Ante-Nicene writers consistently spoke of Christ "bearing" sin as his entry into the human condition in order to heal it, destroy death, and restore communion with God. Their emphasis was on participatory restoration and victory over corruption, not on the Father imputing sin to the Son and then punishing him in place of humanity.

Irenaeus, Athanasius, and other early fathers understood Christ's work as **recapitulation**—entering fully into the human condition (including its corruption and death) in order to heal it from within and lead humanity out of bondage.

---

#### Summary: Real Encounter, Not Legal Transfer

Read within its priestly and sacrificial context, Isaiah 53:6 does not describe the imputation of guilt upon the Servant. It describes the **real encounter with the sinful condition of the people**—their corruption, their exile, their death—being laid upon the Servant so that he might bear it away.

This is not legal fiction. It is participatory reality. The Servant does not become guilty; he becomes the one who enters death in order to break its power.

---

### The Silent Servant and the Lamb (Isaiah 53:7)

> "He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter…" (Isaiah 53:7)

The lamb imagery here does not imply punishment by God. Lambs in Israel's sacrificial system are offered within a **cultic and priestly framework** for cleansing and restoration, not for penal execution.

The Servant's silence reflects faithful obedience and trust in God, not judicial guilt or condemnation.

---

### "He Himself Bore Our Sins in His Body on the Tree" (1 Peter 2:24)

Peter's language in 1 Peter 2:24 is often cited alongside Isaiah 53 as proof of penal substitution:

> "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed." (1 Peter 2:24, KJV)

Peter is explicitly drawing from Isaiah 53, using the same language of bearing and healing. But notice what Peter emphasizes:

- **"Bare our sins"** — The same priestly language of bearing we saw in Isaiah 53:6 and Leviticus 10:17
- **"That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness"** — The purpose is not legal acquittal but **death to the old life and living in righteousness**
- **"By whose stripes ye were healed"** — Peter quotes Isaiah 53:5 directly, emphasizing **healing** as the result

Peter's interpretation confirms what we have already seen. Christ bears sin not by having guilt imputed to him, but by entering into the human condition under sin in order to bring us out of it. The goal is not that we might be declared righteous while remaining unchanged, but that we might **die to sins and live unto righteousness**—participatory transformation, not legal fiction.

Peter's language is thoroughly consistent with the priestly-participatory framework, not the legal-penal one.

---

### Summary: Participatory Healing, Not Penal Exchange (Isaiah 53:4–7)

Isaiah 53:4–7 does not describe a courtroom. It describes a Servant who:
- enters human suffering (Isaiah 53:4)  
- bears sickness and grief by healing and delivering (Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 8:16–17)  
- is wounded because of human sin, entering its consequences (Isaiah 53:5)  
- brings healing as the stated result (Isaiah 53:5)  
- encounters the real burden of sin laid upon him, which he endures and bears away (Isaiah 53:6)  
- offers himself in faithful obedience within a priestly framework (Isaiah 53:7)
- bears our sins so that we might die to sins and live unto righteousness (1 Peter 2:24)

Isaiah 53 presents **participatory healing**, not penal exchange. The Servant does not absorb punishment; he enters corruption in order to remove it.

---

## "He Became a Curse for Us" — Galatians 3:13

Galatians 3:13 is often reduced to a single equation: curse equals punishment. Paul's argument, however, is far more precise and far more rooted in Israel's covenantal world.

Paul writes:

> **"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written,  
> Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree."**  
> (Galatians 3:13, KJV)

Paul does not invent the meaning of "curse" here. He explicitly anchors his statement in the Torah, and we must let that text define what "curse" means.

---

### The Scriptural Definition of "Curse"

The passage Paul cites comes from Deuteronomy:

> **"His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day;  
> (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;)  
> that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance."**  
> (Deuteronomy 21:23, KJV)

This text does not describe a judicial punishment inflicted by God. It describes a **condition**—public exposure to death that renders the land defiled and signifies exclusion from covenant blessing.

To be "cursed" in this context is to be:
- cut off from inheritance  
- exposed to death  
- associated with defilement  
- placed under the sign of exile  

The curse is not the act of execution itself. The curse is the **state of being handed over to death** and publicly marked as outside covenant life.

---

### Hanging on a Tree and the Visibility of Death

"Hanging on a tree" functions as a **public sign**. It marks a person as one who has entered the realm of death and exclusion. The concern in Deuteronomy is not that punishment is being completed, but that **defilement is being prolonged**. The body must be removed precisely because death contaminates.

This matters for Paul's argument.

When Christ is crucified, he does not merely die. He dies in a way that **publicly places him under the covenantal sign of the curse**. He enters the condition the curse names—death, defilement, exclusion from inheritance.

But—and this is crucial—he enters that condition **without forfeiting his own inheritance**. He passes through death without being mastered by it.

---

### The Curse as Covenant Condition, Not Legal Sentence

In Scripture, curse is not primarily a courtroom verdict. It is a **covenantal condition**—the inverse of blessing.

- **Blessing** = life, inheritance, communion with God  
- **Curse** = death, exile, loss of inheritance

This is why the curse is so closely bound to mortality:

> "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (Genesis 2:17)

Death is not a punishment added on afterward; it is the **embodiment of the curse itself**. To be under the curse is to be under the dominion of death.

This is why Paul does not say Christ was **punished**. He says Christ **became a curse**—he entered the cursed condition itself.

Christ redeems from the curse not by absorbing retributive justice, but by **entering death itself and passing through it**. The curse is broken not by penalty satisfied, but by death undone through resurrection.

---

### Death Is the Curse

Paul's logic is consistent across his letters:
- sin reigns through death (Romans 5:21)  
- the curse culminates in mortality (Galatians 3:13)  
- redemption requires resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:54-57)  

Christ becomes a curse precisely because he **dies**. He enters the realm where the curse has full dominion, and by rising, he breaks it.

This is why Paul immediately moves from curse to promise and inheritance in Galatians 3:14:

> "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."

The problem is not unpaid punishment, but humanity's bondage to death, which results in lost inheritance. Christ never forfeits his inheritance, but restores it by passing through death and rising from the dead as its rightful heir. Those who are united to him by faith share in that inheritance.

---

### Why Christ Is Not "Accursed" in the Ultimate Sense

Scripture is careful with its language.

In Galatians 3:13, the word for "curse" (*κατάρα*, katara) refers to a **covenantal condition**—the state of being under death and exile. Elsewhere, when Scripture speaks of something being utterly rejected or cut off from God, it uses a different term (*ἀνάθεμα*, anathema).

Paul explicitly distinguishes these categories when he writes:

> **"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed [anathema]."**  
> (1 Corinthians 12:3, KJV)

Christ bears the **sign and condition** of the curse (katara) without becoming an object of divine rejection (anathema). He enters death without becoming separated from the Father. He is exposed to the curse without being condemned by God.

This distinction is essential. Christ experiences the curse—he dies—but he is never rejected by God. The Father does not abandon him; the Father raises him.

---

### Ante-Nicene Witness — Origen on Galatians 3:13

Origen of Alexandria explicitly distinguishes between **bearing the curse** and **being rejected by God**. Commenting on Galatians, Origen is careful to preserve both the righteousness of Christ and the reality of his suffering under the law.

In his *Commentary on Galatians*, he writes:

> *"Christ is said to be made a curse, not because He was accursed by God, but because He took upon Himself the accursed condition of those who were under the law."*  
> (Commentary on Galatians, fragment preserved in the Latin tradition)

Origen's distinction is exact and deliberate. Christ does not become accursed *by God*; he enters the **accursed condition** produced by life under the law—public exposure, dishonor, mortality, and death. Yet even in entering this condition, Christ does not lose his inheritance; rather, by enduring death faithfully and rising victorious, he reveals himself as the one to whom all inheritance truly belongs.

This language aligns directly with Paul's own care elsewhere. Paul explicitly states:

> *"No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed."*  
> (1 Corinthians 12:3)

Paul and Origen are saying the same thing in different registers. Christ bears the **sign and reality of the curse** without becoming an object of divine rejection. What he assumes is not guilt imputed to him, but the lived reality of the curse itself—mortality and death—so that it might be overcome.

This is the critical distinction: **the curse is experienced, not imputed as guilt**.

Christ enters the cursed condition in order to redeem those trapped within it. He does not become guilty; he becomes mortal. And by dying and rising, he breaks the curse from the inside.

---

### Summary: The Curse Overcome, Not Satisfied

Galatians 3:13 does not teach that God punished Christ instead of sinners. It teaches that Christ **entered the cursed condition itself**—death and exile under the law—in order to redeem those trapped within it.

The curse is not a sentence to be satisfied.  
The curse is a condition to be overcome.

Christ does not lose inheritance under the curse; he enters death without being mastered by it. By dying and rising, he breaks the curse from within and restores inheritance to those who were enslaved to death.

**Death is the curse.**  
**Resurrection is the redemption.**

---

## "He Made Him Who Knew No Sin to Be Sin" — 2 Corinthians 5:21

This verse is frequently cited as a clear statement of penal substitution, yet when examined carefully within its context and biblical usage, it speaks more naturally of priestly mediation than legal exchange.

Paul writes:

> **"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."**  
> (2 Corinthians 5:21, KJV)

At first glance, this appears to support the idea that Christ was made guilty in our place. But several factors challenge that reading.

---

### The Dual Meaning of "Sin" in Scripture

In Scripture, and consistently in the Septuagint, the same Greek word (*ἁμαρτία*, hamartia) is used for both **sin** and **sin offering**. This is not accidental—it reflects the Hebrew usage where *ḥaṭṭāʾt* carries both meanings.

This dual usage appears throughout the Old Testament:
- Leviticus 4:24 — "the place where they kill the burnt offering shall he kill the **sin offering**" (ḥaṭṭāʾt)
- Leviticus 6:25 — "This is the law of the **sin offering**" (ḥaṭṭāʾt)
- Numbers 8:8 — "a young bullock for a **sin offering**" (ḥaṭṭāʾt)

The Septuagint translates all of these with *hamartia*—the same word Paul uses in 2 Corinthians 5:21.

Given this established biblical usage, Paul's statement can be read as:

> "For he hath made him [to be] a **sin offering** for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."

This reading makes Christ the **place where sin is dealt with**, not the one who becomes guilty. He is the offering that removes sin, not the sinner who receives punishment.

---

### The Context: Reconciliation, Not Retribution

The surrounding context of 2 Corinthians 5 emphasizes **reconciliation**, not punishment:

> "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, **not imputing their trespasses unto them**; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation." (2 Corinthians 5:19, KJV)

Paul explicitly says that God was **not imputing** trespasses. If God was not counting sins against humanity, then he was not counting them against Christ either. The focus is on **reconciliation**—the restoration of relationship—not on the transfer of guilt and execution of penalty.

Paul continues:

> "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." (2 Corinthians 5:20, KJV)

The appeal is for reconciliation, not for acceptance of a legal verdict. The problem being addressed is **alienation**, not unpaid debt.

### "That We Might Be Made the Righteousness of God in Him"

The second half of verse 21 is equally important:

> "that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."

This is not the language of legal imputation. It is the language of **participation and transformation**. We are not merely declared righteous while remaining unchanged; we are **made** righteous **in him**—through union with Christ.

This echoes Paul's consistent emphasis on being "in Christ" as the location of salvation. Righteousness is not a legal status applied from outside; it is a reality that belongs to those who are united to Christ.

### Christ as the Place Where Sin Is Confronted

When we read 2 Corinthians 5:21 within its biblical and contextual framework, it speaks of Christ as the **sin offering**—the place where sin is confronted, dealt with, and removed. He is not made guilty; he is made the means by which guilt is taken away.

This is consistent with the priestly framework we have seen throughout Scripture:
- The sin offering does not become guilty  
- The priest who bears iniquity is not punished  
- The scapegoat that carries sin away is not condemned  

Christ, as both priest and offering, enters into the reality of sin in order to remove it. He confronts corruption in order to cleanse it. He bears sin in order to take it away.

### Summary: Priestly Mediation, Not Legal Exchange

2 Corinthians 5:21 does not teach that Christ was made guilty so that we might be declared innocent. It teaches that Christ was made a **sin offering**—the place where sin is dealt with—so that we might be made righteous **in him** through participation in his death and resurrection.

The surrounding context emphasizes:
- Reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18-19)  
- New creation (2 Corinthians 5:17)  
- Restored relationship (2 Corinthians 5:20)  
- Participation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21)

This is **participatory transformation**, not legal exchange. Christ does not become a sinner; he becomes the means by which sinners are cleansed and made new.

## "The Wrath of God" and Romans 1-3

Texts that speak of "the wrath of God" are often assumed to describe retributive anger that must be appeased through punishment. However, when examined within their biblical context, these passages more naturally describe God's **opposition to corruption** and his **giving people over** to the consequences of their rebellion (Romans 1:24, 26, 28).

The word "wrath" itself has undergone significant semantic shift in English, moving from its biblical meaning toward a more emotional and retributive sense. This shift in meaning—and how it affects our reading of key theological terms—is addressed in detail in **Chapter 19: Hijacked Words: Wrath, Propitiation, Atonement, Justice**.

For the purposes of this chapter, it is sufficient to note that wrath in Scripture is not an emotion that needs to be satisfied, but God's settled opposition to sin and death. It is resolved not by punishment inflicted on a substitute, but by the **removal of corruption** through cleansing and restoration.

The biblical concept of wrath, when understood within its proper semantic range and cultic context, does not support penal substitution. It supports the participatory-restorative framework this book has been presenting throughout.

## Why These Texts Feel So Strong

These passages feel compelling to those who hold penal substitutionary atonement because they are read within a legal framework that already assumes:
- Sin is primarily legal guilt  
- Justice requires retributive punishment  
- Atonement means penalty paid  

When those assumptions are in place, these texts seem to confirm the framework.

But outside that framework, the same texts speak naturally of:
- Death as bondage and corruption  
- Cleansing as the means of restoration  
- Liberation through participation in Christ's death and resurrection  
- Healing rather than legal acquittal  

Christians often talk past one another not because they reject Scripture, but because they disagree about **what kind of problem salvation addresses**. If the problem is legal guilt, then penal substitution makes sense. If the problem is bondage to corruption and death, then participatory deliverance makes sense.

The question is not whether these texts are authoritative, but **what framework best allows them to speak on their own terms**.

## Conclusion

Penal substitutionary atonement draws its strength from Scripture, but that strength depends on assumptions Scripture itself does not require and a framework that is foreign to the Levitical cult.

The Levitical system—the cultic framework God himself established—operates through priestly mediation, blood as cleansing agent, and atonement accomplished in the sanctuary. It knows nothing of courtroom verdicts, legal substitution, or retributive punishment transferred from one party to another. When a legal-forensic framework is imposed upon texts that were written within a cultic-priestly framework, the result is not clarification but distortion.

When atonement is located where Scripture locates it—within priestly, heavenly mediation—the biblical story coheres around participation, deliverance, and resurrection. When the curse is understood as a condition to be overcome rather than a sentence to be satisfied, Galatians 3:13 speaks of liberation. When bearing sin is understood within priestly categories rather than legal ones, Isaiah 53 and 2 Corinthians 5:21 speak of healing and restoration.

These texts do not collapse when read outside a penal framework.  
They clarify.

The strongest biblical case for penal substitution depends on reading these passages through a legal-retributive lens that is foreign to the cultic system in which they were written. When that lens is removed and the texts are allowed to speak within their own biblical categories—priestly, covenantal, participatory—they consistently point toward a different understanding of salvation:

- Christ enters death in order to defeat it  
- He bears sin in order to remove it  
- He becomes a curse in order to break it  
- He is made a sin offering in order to cleanse us  

And he invites believers not merely to accept a verdict pronounced over them from a distance, but to **enter the death that leads to life**—to be buried with him, so that his resurrection life may truly become theirs.

This is not a weakening of the gospel.  
It is the gospel as Scripture presents it.

## A Pastoral Word

For many believers, penal substitutionary atonement has been the only framework through which they have understood the cross. To question it can feel like questioning the gospel itself. This chapter is not written to destroy faith, but to deepen it.

The good news is not diminished when we move from a legal-forensic framework to a priestly-participatory one. If anything, it becomes **more personal, more transformative, and more hopeful**.

In the penal framework, Christ's work remains external to us. He is punished in our place, and we receive the legal benefits of his death. But we remain fundamentally unchanged—declared righteous while still living under the same bondage.

In the participatory framework, Christ's work becomes **our work**. We are united to him in his death, so that his victory over death becomes ours. We are not merely declared free—we are **made free**. We do not merely receive a legal status—we receive **new life**.

This is why Paul does not say, "Christ was punished so you don't have to be." He says, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20).

This is why baptism is not merely a symbol of something that happened to Christ. It is **participation** in what happened to Christ, so that what happened to him might happen to us—death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3-4).

This is why the Christian life is not about trying harder to obey while remaining in the same condition. It is about **living from a new place**—no longer under the dominion of death, but alive to God in Christ Jesus (Romans 6:11).

The gospel is not that Christ was punished so we could avoid death.  
The gospel is that Christ entered death so we could pass through it with him and emerge on the other side.

The gospel is not that we are declared righteous while remaining unchanged.  
The gospel is that we are made new creatures in Christ—old things passed away, all things become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).

The gospel is not that we are spared from dying.  
The gospel is that we are invited to die rightly—with Christ—so that we might live truly.

For those who have found comfort in penal substitution, this is not a call to abandon what has sustained you. It is an invitation to discover that the comfort you have found is real, but the **reason** for that comfort may be deeper than you knew.

Christ did die for you. But not as a legal substitute absorbing punishment. He died for you as the faithful high priest who entered death itself in order to bring you through it. He bore your sins not by becoming guilty, but by entering the condition sin produces—corruption, exile, death—and breaking its power from within.

You are not merely forgiven from a distance.  
You are united to the one who conquered death.

You are not merely declared righteous by legal fiction.  
You are made righteous by participation in the one who is righteousness itself.

You are not left to manage the old life with divine assistance.  
You have been brought through death into new life.

This is the gospel. And it is better news than we dared imagine.
