# Chapter 26 — Penal Substitution: The Strongest Biblical Case

## Introduction

If penal substitutionary atonement is to be rejected, it must not be dismissed casually or caricatured. Its defenders consistently appeal to Scripture, often with sincerity and deep concern for God’s justice, holiness, and the seriousness of sin. Many of the verses cited in support of penal substitution are not obscure or marginal. They are central texts—familiar, weighty, and repeatedly preached.

This chapter takes those passages seriously.

The claim of this book is not that these verses are ignored or evaded, but that **they are often read through a framework and set of definitions that Scripture itself does not require**. When those definitions and frameworks are re-examined—particularly in light of biblical ontology, Second Temple context, priestly categories, and the language of participation—many of the strongest proof texts for penal substitution no longer function as intended.

Before turning to individual passages, one foundational assumption must be addressed: **where Scripture locates the act of atonement itself**. That question quietly governs how every text in this chapter is read.

What follows is not an exhaustive refutation, but a careful re-reading—one that allows Scripture to set its own terms.

## What Penal Substitutionary Atonement Claims

Penal substitutionary atonement is not merely the belief that Christ died “for us,” or that his death was necessary for salvation. It is a specific theological framework with identifiable commitments, most clearly articulated within Reformed and Calvinist theology.

In its classical form, penal substitution teaches:

- **The primary problem salvation addresses is legal guilt before God.** Humanity stands condemned under divine law and requires judicial satisfaction.

- **God’s justice is fundamentally retributive.** Sin must be punished; it cannot simply be forgiven without violating justice.

- **God’s wrath is directed toward sinners as lawbreakers.** This wrath is judicial and awaits execution.

- **Christ acts as a legal substitute.** The guilt of sinners is imputed to Christ, who is treated as guilty in their place.

- **Christ is punished by the Father.** On the cross, Christ endures the penalty required by divine justice, satisfying wrath.

- **The cross is the site where atonement is completed.** Salvation is finished on earth at the moment punishment is executed.

- **Justification is a legal declaration.** Because the penalty is paid, believers are declared righteous through imputation.

Within this framework, legal metaphors are not illustrative but operative. Courtroom imagery is treated as the mechanism by which salvation works.

This chapter does not question the sincerity behind this doctrine. It does question whether Scripture itself constructs salvation in this way.

## The Location of Atonement: Earthly Shadows and Heavenly Reality

Before engaging individual proof texts, Scripture demands that we ask a prior question: **where does atonement occur?**

Penal substitution assumes that the decisive atoning act occurs on the cross, on earth, through punishment. Hebrews presents a different—and more precise—account.

---

### Atonement in the Levitical System

Under the Mosaic covenant, atonement was not accomplished at the moment an animal died. Death was necessary, but **death itself was not the atoning act**.

Atonement occurred when the high priest:
- Entered the sanctuary  
- Carried the blood  
- Applied it within the holy place  
- Acted as mediator before God  

The location of atonement was the **priestly and cultic sphere**, culminating in the Most Holy Place. Bloodshed enabled atonement; **priestly mediation completed it**.

Sacrifice without priesthood did not effect atonement.

---

### The Argument of Hebrews

Hebrews insists that the Levitical system was a **shadow**, not the reality. Earthly priests served copies of a heavenly reality, and Christ’s priesthood belongs to that higher order.

Hebrews makes several structural claims:

- Christ is not a priest on earth  
- Earthly priests minister shadows  
- Christ ministers in the **heavenly sanctuary**  
- Atonement occurs when Christ **enters** as high priest  

> “If he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all.” (Hebrews 8)

This is not incidental. It is architectural.

Christ’s death is necessary, but Hebrews consistently locates atonement in Christ’s **entry, presentation, and mediation** before God.

---

### Death Enables; Priesthood Accomplishes

Hebrews never presents Christ’s death as the isolated moment where justice is satisfied. Instead, death:
- Provides the blood  
- Ends the old order  
- Enables entrance into the true sanctuary  

Atonement itself occurs in Christ’s **living priestly ministry**, not in punishment at a moment in time.

Thus Hebrews frames salvation in terms of:
- Cleansing  
- Access  
- Drawing near  
- Purified conscience  
- Mediated communion  

These are priestly categories, not judicial ones.

---

### “The Finished Work of Christ on the Cross”

At this point, a familiar phrase must be addressed: *“the finished work of Christ on the cross.”*

Within a penal framework, this phrase means that atonement was completed on earth when punishment was executed and wrath was satisfied. Scripture itself uses more careful language.

When Jesus declares, “It is finished,” the Scriptures do not say that priestly atonement was completed at that moment. They say that Christ’s obedience, self-offering, and passage through death were completed.

Hebrews is explicit: Christ’s saving work **moves through death into priestly action**.

Completion is not denied—it is **located**.

Christ’s work is finished in the sense that:
- No further sacrifice is needed  
- Nothing remains to be added  
- The old order is ended  

But it is finished **as priestly accomplishment**, not as penal execution.

Resurrection, ascension, and heavenly mediation are not appendices to salvation; they are integral to it.

---

### Why This Undermines Penal Substitution at Its Core

Penal substitution requires that atonement be:
- Completed on earth  
- Executed through punishment  
- Resolved at death  

Hebrews explicitly denies this structure.

If Christ’s priesthood is heavenly:
- The cross is not a courtroom  
- The Father is not executing a sentence  
- Atonement cannot be reduced to punishment  

The cross is the means by which Christ **enters death**, so that, as risen high priest, he may carry humanity through death and into restored communion.

## Isaiah 53 — “Smitten,” “Stricken,” and “Bruised”

Isaiah 53 is often treated as the clearest Old Testament statement of penal substitution. Yet the text never describes a legal transaction.

There is no courtroom, verdict, or sentence.

The Servant suffers, but suffering is not automatically punishment. Scripture frequently portrays suffering as the result of **entering a broken condition**, not the execution of justice.

Crucially, the text frames the observers’ misunderstanding:

> “We esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.”

This is a confession of **misinterpretation**, not divine explanation. The passage then corrects that assumption by explaining that the Servant bears sickness, corruption, and exile.

The Servant “bears” sin as the scapegoat bears sin—by **carrying it away**, not by receiving punishment instead of the guilty.

Isaiah 53 presents participatory healing, not penal exchange.

---

## “He Became a Curse for Us” — Galatians 3:13

Galatians 3:13 is often reduced to a single equation: curse equals punishment. Paul’s argument is far richer.

To be cursed in Scripture is to enter a **covenantal condition**—exile, death, and loss of inheritance—not to receive a legal sentence.

“Hanging on a tree” signifies public exposure to death. Christ becomes a curse by **entering the condition the curse names**, not by being punished.

Death is the curse.

Christ redeems from the curse by **dying and rising**, not by satisfying retributive justice.

Scripture is careful never to call Christ accursed in the ultimate sense. He bears the sign of the curse without becoming an object of divine rejection.

---

## “He Made Him Who Knew No Sin to Be Sin” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

This verse is often treated as a penal formula. Paul says no such thing.

In Scripture—and consistently in the Septuagint—the same word is used for **sin** and **sin offering**. Paul assumes this usage.

Christ is not made guilty. He is made the place where sin is confronted and undone.

The surrounding context emphasizes:
- Reconciliation  
- New creation  
- Restored relationship  

This is participatory transformation, not legal exchange.

---

## Propitiation Passages

Texts using “propitiation” are often assumed to describe appeasement of divine anger. That assumption rests on **modern English usage**, not biblical meaning.

In Scripture, propitiation concerns:
- Cleansing  
- Covering  
- Removal of defilement  
- Restored presence  

The object is not God’s emotions, but the **condition that prevents communion**.

---

## Why These Texts Feel So Strong

These passages feel compelling because they are read within a legal framework that already assumes penal substitution. Outside that framework, they speak naturally of death, cleansing, liberation, and restoration.

Christians often talk past one another not because they reject Scripture, but because they disagree about **what kind of problem salvation addresses**.

---

## Conclusion

Penal substitution draws strength from Scripture, but that strength depends on assumptions Scripture itself does not require.

When atonement is located where Scripture locates it—within priestly, heavenly mediation—the biblical story coheres around participation, deliverance, and resurrection.

These texts do not collapse.  
They clarify.

And they invite believers not merely to accept a verdict, but to **enter a death that leads to life**.
