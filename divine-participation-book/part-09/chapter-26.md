# Chapter 26 — Penal Substitution: The Strongest Biblical Case

## Introduction

Penal substitutionary atonement (PSA) is the most prevalent understanding of the cross within modern evangelical Christianity and Protestant churches.

Within Reformed and Calvinist traditions, PSA is viewed as the Gospel itself. In broader evangelical contexts, the PSA framework is frequently adopted in practice, even when its theological structure is not fully articulated or understand. Phrases such as “Jesus took our punishment,” “the wrath of God was poured out on Christ,” and “the work of salvation was finished on the cross” are commonly used as summaries of the gospel itself and are rooted in the PSA framework.

Because of its widespread influence, penal substitutionary atonement deserves careful and serious engagement.

If PSA is to be questioned or rejected, it must not be dismissed casually or caricatured. Its defenders consistently appeal to Scripture, often with sincerity and deep concern for God’s justice and the seriousness of sin. Many of the verses cited in support of penal substitution are not obscure or marginal. They are central texts that are familiar to many and repeatedly preached to promote the framework of PSA.

This chapter takes those passages seriously.

The claim of this book is not that these verses are ignored or evaded, but that **they are often read through a framework and set of definitions that Scripture itself does not require**. When those definitions and frameworks are re-examined, particularly in light of biblical ontology, Second Temple context, priestly categories, and the language of participation, many of the strongest proof texts for PSA no longer function as intended.

## What Penal Substitutionary Atonement Claims

Penal substitutionary atonement is not merely the belief that Christ died “for us,” or that his death was necessary for salvation. It is a specific theological framework with identifiable commitments, most clearly articulated within Reformed and Calvinist theology.

In its classical form, penal substitution teaches:

- **The primary problem salvation addresses is legal guilt before God.** Humanity stands condemned under divine law and requires judicial satisfaction.

- **God’s justice is fundamentally retributive.** Sin must be punished; it cannot simply be forgiven without violating justice.

- **God’s wrath is directed toward sinners as lawbreakers.** This wrath is judicial and awaits execution.

- **Christ acts as a legal substitute.** The guilt of sinners is imputed to Christ, who is treated as guilty in their place.

- **Christ is punished by the Father.** On the cross, Christ endures the penalty required by divine justice, satisfying wrath.

- **The cross is the site where atonement is completed.** Salvation is finished on earth at the moment punishment is executed.

- **Justification is a legal declaration.** Because the penalty is paid, believers are declared righteous through imputation.

Within this framework, legal metaphors are not illustrative but operative. Courtroom imagery is treated as the mechanism by which salvation works.

This chapter does not question the sincerity behind this doctrine. It does question whether Scripture itself constructs salvation in this way.

## The Location of Atonement: Earthly Shadows and Heavenly Reality

Before turning to individual passages, we need to ask the question: **where does atonement occur?**.  More specifically: **where does the atonment by Jesus Christ occur?**.

Penal substitutionary atonement teaches that the decisive atoning act occurs on the cross, on earth, through punishment. Hebrews presents a different, and more precise location of where the atonemnt occurs and why.

---

### Atonement in the Levitical System

Under the Mosaic covenant, atonement was not accomplished at the moment an animal died. Death was necessary, but **death itself was not the atoning act or the focus of the atonement process**.

Atonement occurred when the high priest:
- Entered the sanctuary  
- Carried the blood  
- Applied it within the holy place  
- Acted as mediator before God  

Death was necessary to accomplish atonement, but death is not atonement.  The atonement was accomplished by presenting the blood in the Most Holy Place. Additionally, sin offerings were similar in presenting blood not death.

Death itself is not atonement (cleansing).

---

### The Argument of Hebrews

The epistle of Hebrews insists that the Levitical system was a **shadow**, not the reality. Earthly priests served copies of a heavenly reality, and Christ’s priesthood belongs to that higher order and not the Levitical order.

Hebrews makes several structural claims:

- Christ is not a priest on earth  
- Earthly priests minister shadows  
- Christ ministers in the **heavenly sanctuary**  
- Atonement occurs when Christ **enters** as high priest and presents **his** blood

> “If he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all.” (Hebrews 8)

This is not incidental. It is architectural.

Christ’s death is necessary, but Hebrews specifically locates the atonement in the heavenly tabernacle where Christ **entered and presentated his blood as high priest** before God.

---

### Death Enables; Priesthood Accomplishes

Hebrews never presents Christ’s death as the isolated moment where justice is satisfied. Instead, death:
- Provides the blood  
- Ends the old order  
- Enables entrance into the true sanctuary  

Atonement itself occurs in Christ’s **living priestly ministry**, not in punishment at a moment in time on earth.

Thus Hebrews frames salvation in terms of:
- Cleansing  
- Access  
- Drawing near  
- Purified conscience  
- Mediated communion  

These are priestly categories, not judicial ones.

---

### “The Finished Work of Christ on the Cross”

At this point, a familiar phrase must be addressed: *“the finished work of Christ on the cross.”*

Within a penal framework, this phrase means that atonement was completed on earth when punishment was executed and wrath was satisfied. Scripture itself uses more careful language.

When Jesus declares, “It is finished,” the Scriptures do not say that priestly atonement was completed at that moment. They say that Christ’s obedience, self-offering, and passage through death were completed, **not atonement**.

Hebrews is explicit: Christ’s saving work **moves through death into priestly action**.

Completion is not denied—it is **located**.

Christ’s work is finished in the sense that:
- No further sacrifice is needed  
- Nothing remains to be added  
- The old order is ended  

But it is finished **as priestly accomplishment**, not as penal execution.

Resurrection, ascension, and heavenly mediation are not appendices to salvation; they are integral to it.

---

### Why This Undermines Penal Substitution at Its Core

Penal substitutionary atonement requires that atonement be:
- Completed on earth  
- Executed through punishment  
- Resolved at death  

Hebrews explicitly denies this structure.

If Christ’s priesthood is heavenly:
- The cross is not a courtroom  
- The Father is not executing a sentence  
- Atonement cannot be reduced to punishment  

The cross is the means by which Christ **enters death**, so that, as risen high priest, he may carry humanity through death and into restored communion.

See the following table for comparison:

| Category | Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) | Biblical Temple-Cleansing Atonement |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Location of Atonement** | On earth, at the cross, where punishment is executed and justice is satisfied | In the heavenly sanctuary through Christ’s high-priestly mediation |
| **Primary Problem Addressed** | Legal guilt before God | Defilement, corruption, and death |
| **Nature of Sin** | Law-breaking requiring punishment | Polluting, corrupting power that brings death and exile |
| **Role of Death** | Penal punishment inflicted in place of sinners | Necessary passage into death in order to defeat it and remove corruption |
| **Function of Blood** | Evidence that punishment has been carried out | Cleansing agent that purifies persons and sacred space |
| **Role of the Priest** | Minimal or symbolic; focus is on execution of penalty | Central and essential; atonement is completed through priestly mediation |
| **Sequence of Salvation** | Death completes atonement; resurrection confirms it | Death enables atonement; resurrection and heavenly mediation accomplish it |
| **Understanding of Wrath** | Retributive anger requiring satisfaction | God’s opposition to corruption and death, resolved through cleansing and restoration |
| **Outcome of Atonement** | Legal acquittal and imputed righteousness | Cleansed conscience, restored access, union with God, and new creation life |
| **Controlling Metaphor** | Courtroom and Judicial | Cleansing and Purification |
| **View of the Cross** | Site where justice is satisfied | Necessary passage through death that leads to priestly mediation and victory |

## Isaiah 53 — “Smitten,” “Stricken,” and “Bruised”

Isaiah 53 is often treated as the clearest Old Testament statement of penal substitutionary atonement. For that reason, it deserves careful, unhurried attention. Rather than isolating phrases or assuming a framework in advance, it is best to hear the passage as a whole and then respond to its internal logic.

What follows begins with the text itself.

---

### Isaiah 53:4–7 (KJV)

> **Isaiah 53:4** — “Surely he hath borne our griefs,  
> and carried our sorrows:  
> yet we did esteem him stricken,  
> smitten of God, and afflicted.  
>  
> **Isaiah 53:5** — But he was wounded for our transgressions,  
> he was bruised for our iniquities:  
> the chastisement of our peace was upon him;  
> and with his stripes we are healed.  
>  
> **Isaiah 53:6** — All we like sheep have gone astray;  
> we have turned every one to his own way;  
> and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.  
>  
> **Isaiah 53:7** — He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,  
> yet he opened not his mouth:  
> he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,  
> and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb,  
> so he openeth not his mouth.”

---

### “We Esteemed Him Smitten of God” (Isaiah 53:4)

The passage itself begins by identifying a **misinterpretation**:

> “Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.” (Isaiah 53:4)

This line does not explain what God was doing to the Servant. It explains what the observers *thought* God was doing. Isaiah frames this as a confession of misunderstanding, not as divine commentary.

The text then immediately corrects that assumption.

---

### “Surely He Hath Borne Our Griefs” (Isaiah 53:4)

Isaiah defines the Servant’s work before any mention of transgression or iniquity:

> “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows…” (Isaiah 53:4)

The language here is not judicial. It is **experiential and restorative**. Griefs, sorrows, sickness, and affliction are conditions to be carried and removed, not crimes to be punished.

This meaning is confirmed decisively by the Gospel of Matthew.

Matthew explicitly quotes this portion of Isaiah and tells us how it is fulfilled:

> “When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, **that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet**, saying,  
> *‘He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.’*”  
> (Matthew 8:16–17)

Here, Isaiah 53 is fulfilled not at the cross, but in Jesus’ healing ministry. Bearing griefs and sorrows means **entering human brokenness in order to remove it**.

---

### This Interpretation Comes *Before* the Cross (Matthew 8:16–17)

Isaiah 53 is often treated as a prophecy whose meaning is revealed only at the crucifixion and assumed to describe penal punishment. Matthew explicitly contradicts that assumption by locating its fulfillment **before the cross**, in Jesus’ public ministry of healing and deliverance.

This does not deny the cross. It **governs how the cross is understood**.

If Isaiah 53 already means:
- bearing sickness  
- carrying grief  
- removing corruption  

then it cannot later be redefined to mean:
- absorbing divine punishment  
- satisfying retributive justice  

Scripture does not permit such a shift in meaning.

---

### “Wounded for Our Transgressions” (Isaiah 53:5)

Isaiah then moves from sickness and sorrow to transgression and iniquity:

> “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities…” (Isaiah 53:5)

The preposition *for* does not demand penal substitution. It regularly denotes **purpose, result, or involvement**, not punishment. The Servant is wounded *because of* human sin, not *in order to receive punishment instead of sinners*.

The stated outcome is explicit:

> “With his stripes we are healed.” (Isaiah 53:5)

Healing—not acquittal—is the stated result.

---

### “The LORD Hath Laid on Him the Iniquity of Us All” (Isaiah 53:6)

This scripture is often used as a summary statement of penal substitution:

> “And the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.”  
> *(Isaiah 53:6)*

This scripture is commonly read from a legal penal framework and is therefore understood to mean that guilt is transferred to the Servant and this is why the servant is punished. The temple framework (i.e Levitical sacrificial system) and the Septuagint (LXX) don't allow reading it from a legal penal framework.

Leviticus explicitly states that the priest “bears the iniquity of the congregation” in order to make atonement (Lev. 10:17), yet the priest is not punished; bearing iniquity is a priestly act of mediation and removal, not a transfer of retributive penalty.

Additionally, in the Septuagint (LXX), the wording of this verse reinforces a meaning of encounter and bearing rather than legal imputation. Isaiah 53:6 uses the verb **ἐπέθηκεν** (“laid upon”) together with the phrase **τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν πάντων** (“the sins of us all”), describing the LORD as causing the iniquity of all to **come upon** or **be placed upon** the Servant.

Crucially, this language does not denote the assignment of guilt for punishment. In the LXX, **ἐπιτίθημι** regularly carries the sense of placing a burden, bringing something upon someone, or causing one to encounter a condition. It is relational and experiential, not judicial. The Servant is not said to be condemned or punished; he is said to have the burden of iniquity placed upon him so that it may be borne.

For the Second Temple Jewish translators who produced the LXX, this wording would have naturally evoked priestly and cultic imagery, particularly the placing of sin upon a representative figure for the purpose of removal. The emphasis is not on retribution, but on **bearing a burden in order to deal with it**.

In this linguistic and sacrificial context, Isaiah 53:6 describes the LORD placing the weight of corruption upon the Servant, so that it may be carried, confronted, and removed, not so that punishment may be redirected to him.

This aligns closely with Levitical atonement imagery. On the Day of Atonement, the scapegoat **bears** the sins of the people, not in the sense that guilt is assigned to it for punishment, but in the sense that it carries the burden of impurity **away** from the community. The action is removal, not retribution. The scapegoat does not become morally guilty, nor is it punished; it becomes the bearer of iniquity so that defilement may be taken outside the camp and the people may be cleansed.

Isaiah 53:6 operates within this same conceptual world. To “lay” iniquity upon the Servant is to place upon him the full weight of Israel’s corruption, exile, and death so that it may be dealt with, removed, and undone. The action is restorative, not retributive.

This understanding also reflects the trajectory of early Christian interpretation. Ante-Nicene writers regularly spoke of Christ “bearing” sin, yet they consistently understood this bearing as Christ entering the human condition in order to heal it, destroy death, and restore communion. Their view was that of participatory restoration and victory over corruption, not the Father punishing the Son instead of humanity.

Read within its own priestly and sacrificial framework, Isaiah 53:6 does not describe a transfer of guilt for punishment. It describes a representative bearing of iniquity so that it may be **carried away**.

---

### The Silent Servant and the Lamb (Isaiah 53:7)

> “He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter…” (Isaiah 53:7)

The lamb imagery here does not imply punishment by God. Lambs in Israel’s sacrificial system are offered within a **cultic and priestly framework** for cleansing and restoration.

The Servant’s silence reflects faithful obedience, not judicial guilt.

---

### Summary: Participatory Healing, Not Penal Exchange (Isaiah 53:4–7)

Isaiah 53:4–7 does not describe a courtroom. It describes a Servant who:
- enters human suffering (Isaiah 53:4)  
- bears sickness and grief (Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 8:16–17)  
- is wounded because of human sin (Isaiah 53:5)  
- brings healing as the stated result (Isaiah 53:5)  
- carries iniquity away rather than receiving punishment (Isaiah 53:6)  

Isaiah 53 presents participatory healing, not penal exchange.

---

## “He Became a Curse for Us” — Galatians 3:13

Galatians 3:13 is often reduced to a single equation: curse equals punishment. Paul’s argument is far richer.

To be cursed in Scripture is to enter a **covenantal condition**—exile, death, and loss of inheritance—not to receive a legal sentence.

“Hanging on a tree” signifies public exposure to death. Christ becomes a curse by **entering the condition the curse names**, not by being punished.

Death is the curse.

Christ redeems from the curse by **dying and rising**, not by satisfying retributive justice.

Scripture is careful never to call Christ accursed in the ultimate sense. He bears the sign of the curse without becoming an object of divine rejection.

---

## “He Made Him Who Knew No Sin to Be Sin” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

This verse is often treated as a penal formula. Paul says no such thing.

In Scripture—and consistently in the Septuagint—the same word is used for **sin** and **sin offering**. Paul assumes this usage.

Christ is not made guilty. He is made the place where sin is confronted and undone.

The surrounding context emphasizes:
- Reconciliation  
- New creation  
- Restored relationship  

This is participatory transformation, not legal exchange.

---

## Propitiation Passages

Texts using “propitiation” are often assumed to describe appeasement of divine anger. That assumption rests on **modern English usage**, not biblical meaning.

In Scripture, propitiation concerns:
- Cleansing  
- Covering  
- Removal of defilement  
- Restored presence  

The object is not God’s emotions, but the **condition that prevents communion**.

---

## Why These Texts Feel So Strong

These passages feel compelling because they are read within a legal framework that already assumes penal substitution. Outside that framework, they speak naturally of death, cleansing, liberation, and restoration.

Christians often talk past one another not because they reject Scripture, but because they disagree about **what kind of problem salvation addresses**.

---

## Conclusion

Penal substitution draws strength from Scripture, but that strength depends on assumptions Scripture itself does not require.

When atonement is located where Scripture locates it—within priestly, heavenly mediation—the biblical story coheres around participation, deliverance, and resurrection.

These texts do not collapse.  
They clarify.

And they invite believers not merely to accept a verdict, but to **enter a death that leads to life**.
