# Chapter 26 — Penal Substitution: The Strongest Biblical Case

## Introduction

Penal substitutionary atonement (PSA) is the most prevalent understanding of the cross within modern evangelical Christianity and Protestant churches.

Within Reformed and Calvinist traditions, PSA is viewed as the Gospel itself. In broader evangelical contexts, the PSA framework is frequently adopted in practice, even when its theological structure is not fully articulated or understand. Phrases such as “Jesus took our punishment,” “the wrath of God was poured out on Christ,” and “the work of salvation was finished on the cross” are commonly used as summaries of the gospel itself and are rooted in the PSA framework.

Because of its widespread influence, penal substitutionary atonement deserves careful and serious engagement.

If PSA is to be questioned or rejected, it must not be dismissed casually or caricatured. Its defenders consistently appeal to Scripture, often with sincerity and deep concern for God’s justice and the seriousness of sin. Many of the verses cited in support of penal substitution are not obscure or marginal. They are central texts that are familiar to many and repeatedly preached to promote the framework of PSA.

This chapter takes those passages seriously.

The claim of this book is not that these verses are ignored or evaded, but that **they are often read through a framework and set of definitions that Scripture itself does not require**. When those definitions and frameworks are re-examined, particularly in light of biblical ontology, Second Temple context, priestly categories, and the language of participation, many of the strongest proof texts for PSA no longer function as intended.

## What Penal Substitutionary Atonement Claims

Penal substitutionary atonement is not merely the belief that Christ died “for us,” or that his death was necessary for salvation. It is a specific theological framework with identifiable commitments, most clearly articulated within Reformed and Calvinist theology.

In its classical form, penal substitution teaches:

- **The primary problem salvation addresses is legal guilt before God.** Humanity stands condemned under divine law and requires judicial satisfaction.

- **God’s justice is fundamentally retributive.** Sin must be punished; it cannot simply be forgiven without violating justice.

- **God’s wrath is directed toward sinners as lawbreakers.** This wrath is judicial and awaits execution.

- **Christ acts as a legal substitute.** The guilt of sinners is imputed to Christ, who is treated as guilty in their place.

- **Christ is punished by the Father.** On the cross, Christ endures the penalty required by divine justice, satisfying wrath.

- **The cross is the site where atonement is completed.** Salvation is finished on earth at the moment punishment is executed.

- **Justification is a legal declaration.** Because the penalty is paid, believers are declared righteous through imputation.

Within this framework, legal metaphors are not illustrative but operative. Courtroom imagery is treated as the mechanism by which salvation works.

This chapter does not question the sincerity behind this doctrine. It does question whether Scripture itself constructs salvation in this way.

## The Location of Atonement: Earthly Shadows and Heavenly Reality

Before turning to individual passages, we need to ask the question: **where does atonement occur?**.  More specifically: **where does the atonment by Jesus Christ occur?**.

Penal substitutionary atonement teaches that the decisive atoning act occurs on the cross, on earth, through punishment. Hebrews presents a different, and more precise location of where the atonemnt occurs and why.

---

### Atonement in the Levitical System

Under the Mosaic covenant, atonement was not accomplished at the moment an animal died. Death was necessary, but **death itself was not the atoning act or the focus of the atonement process**.

Atonement occurred when the high priest:
- Entered the sanctuary  
- Carried the blood  
- Applied it within the holy place  
- Acted as mediator before God  

Death was necessary to accomplish atonement, but death is not atonement.  The atonement was accomplished by presenting the blood in the Most Holy Place. Additionally, sin offerings were similar in presenting blood not death.

Death itself is not atonement (cleansing).

---

### The Argument of Hebrews

The epistle of Hebrews insists that the Levitical system was a **shadow**, not the reality. Earthly priests served copies of a heavenly reality, and Christ’s priesthood belongs to that higher order and not the Levitical order.

Hebrews makes several structural claims:

- Christ is not a priest on earth  
- Earthly priests minister shadows  
- Christ ministers in the **heavenly sanctuary**  
- Atonement occurs when Christ **enters** as high priest and presents **his** blood

> “If he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all.” (Hebrews 8)

This is not incidental. It is architectural.

Christ’s death is necessary, but Hebrews specifically locates the atonement in the heavenly tabernacle where Christ **entered and presentated his blood as high priest** before God.

---

### Death Enables; Priesthood Accomplishes

Hebrews never presents Christ’s death as the isolated moment where justice is satisfied. Instead, death:
- Provides the blood  
- Ends the old order  
- Enables entrance into the true sanctuary  

Atonement itself occurs in Christ’s **living priestly ministry**, not in punishment at a moment in time on earth.

Thus Hebrews frames salvation in terms of:
- Cleansing  
- Access  
- Drawing near  
- Purified conscience  
- Mediated communion  

These are priestly categories, not judicial ones.

---

### “The Finished Work of Christ on the Cross”

At this point, a familiar phrase must be addressed: *“the finished work of Christ on the cross.”*

Within a penal framework, this phrase means that atonement was completed on earth when punishment was executed and wrath was satisfied. Scripture itself uses more careful language.

When Jesus declares, “It is finished,” the Scriptures do not say that priestly atonement was completed at that moment. They say that Christ’s obedience, self-offering, and passage through death were completed, **not atonement**.

Hebrews is explicit: Christ’s saving work **moves through death into priestly action**.

Completion is not denied—it is **located**.

Christ’s work is finished in the sense that:
- No further sacrifice is needed  
- Nothing remains to be added  
- The old order is ended  

But it is finished **as priestly accomplishment**, not as penal execution.

Resurrection, ascension, and heavenly mediation are not appendices to salvation; they are integral to it.

---

### Why This Undermines Penal Substitution at Its Core

Penal substitutionary atonement requires that atonement be:
- Completed on earth  
- Executed through punishment  
- Resolved at death  

Hebrews explicitly denies this structure.

If Christ’s priesthood is heavenly:
- The cross is not a courtroom  
- The Father is not executing a sentence  
- Atonement cannot be reduced to punishment  

The cross is the means by which Christ **enters death**, so that, as risen high priest, he may carry humanity through death and into restored communion.

See the following table for comparison:

| Category | Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) | Biblical Temple-Cleansing Atonement |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Location of Atonement** | On earth, at the cross, where punishment is executed and justice is satisfied | In the priestly and cultic sphere; ultimately in the heavenly sanctuary through Christ’s high-priestly mediation |
| **Primary Problem Addressed** | Legal guilt before God | Defilement, corruption, death, and loss of access to God |
| **Nature of Sin** | Law-breaking requiring punishment | Polluting, corrupting power that brings death and exile |
| **Role of Death** | Penal punishment inflicted in place of sinners | Necessary passage into death in order to defeat it and remove corruption |
| **Function of Blood** | Evidence that punishment has been carried out | Cleansing agent that purifies persons and sacred space |
| **Role of the Priest** | Minimal or symbolic; focus rests on execution of penalty | Central and essential; atonement is completed through priestly mediation |
| **Sequence of Salvation** | Death completes atonement; resurrection confirms it | Death enables atonement; resurrection and heavenly mediation accomplish it |
| **Meaning of “Bearing Sin”** | Legal transfer of guilt and punishment | Carrying away sin through identification and removal |
| **Understanding of Wrath** | Retributive anger requiring satisfaction | God’s opposition to corruption and death, resolved through cleansing and restoration |
| **Outcome of Atonement** | Legal acquittal and imputed righteousness | Cleansed conscience, restored access, union with God, and new creation life |
| **Controlling Metaphor** | Courtroom and sentence | Temple, priesthood, cleansing, and access |
| **View of the Cross** | Site where justice is satisfied | Necessary passage through death that leads to priestly mediation and victory |

## Isaiah 53 — “Smitten,” “Stricken,” and “Bruised”

Isaiah 53 is often treated as the clearest Old Testament statement of penal substitution. Yet the text never describes a legal transaction.

There is no courtroom, verdict, or sentence.

The Servant suffers, but suffering is not automatically punishment. Scripture frequently portrays suffering as the result of **entering a broken condition**, not the execution of justice.

Crucially, the text frames the observers’ misunderstanding:

> “We esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.”

This is a confession of **misinterpretation**, not divine explanation. The passage then corrects that assumption by explaining that the Servant bears sickness, corruption, and exile.

The Servant “bears” sin as the scapegoat bears sin—by **carrying it away**, not by receiving punishment instead of the guilty.

Isaiah 53 presents participatory healing, not penal exchange.

---

## “He Became a Curse for Us” — Galatians 3:13

Galatians 3:13 is often reduced to a single equation: curse equals punishment. Paul’s argument is far richer.

To be cursed in Scripture is to enter a **covenantal condition**—exile, death, and loss of inheritance—not to receive a legal sentence.

“Hanging on a tree” signifies public exposure to death. Christ becomes a curse by **entering the condition the curse names**, not by being punished.

Death is the curse.

Christ redeems from the curse by **dying and rising**, not by satisfying retributive justice.

Scripture is careful never to call Christ accursed in the ultimate sense. He bears the sign of the curse without becoming an object of divine rejection.

---

## “He Made Him Who Knew No Sin to Be Sin” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

This verse is often treated as a penal formula. Paul says no such thing.

In Scripture—and consistently in the Septuagint—the same word is used for **sin** and **sin offering**. Paul assumes this usage.

Christ is not made guilty. He is made the place where sin is confronted and undone.

The surrounding context emphasizes:
- Reconciliation  
- New creation  
- Restored relationship  

This is participatory transformation, not legal exchange.

---

## Propitiation Passages

Texts using “propitiation” are often assumed to describe appeasement of divine anger. That assumption rests on **modern English usage**, not biblical meaning.

In Scripture, propitiation concerns:
- Cleansing  
- Covering  
- Removal of defilement  
- Restored presence  

The object is not God’s emotions, but the **condition that prevents communion**.

---

## Why These Texts Feel So Strong

These passages feel compelling because they are read within a legal framework that already assumes penal substitution. Outside that framework, they speak naturally of death, cleansing, liberation, and restoration.

Christians often talk past one another not because they reject Scripture, but because they disagree about **what kind of problem salvation addresses**.

---

## Conclusion

Penal substitution draws strength from Scripture, but that strength depends on assumptions Scripture itself does not require.

When atonement is located where Scripture locates it—within priestly, heavenly mediation—the biblical story coheres around participation, deliverance, and resurrection.

These texts do not collapse.  
They clarify.

And they invite believers not merely to accept a verdict, but to **enter a death that leads to life**.
