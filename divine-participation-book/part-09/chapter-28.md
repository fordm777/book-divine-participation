# Chapter 28 — When Words Change but Assumptions Don't

## Introduction: The Illusion of Progress

Theological language changes more easily than theological imagination. Words are updated, softened, or replaced, but the underlying assumptions often remain untouched. This creates the illusion of doctrinal development while leaving the governing framework intact.

This chapter is not primarily about mistranslation or bad faith. It is about **conceptual inertia**—the tendency of inherited assumptions to survive even when the vocabulary meant to express them has changed. When this happens, new words are quietly conscripted to serve old ideas.

The result is a strange theological situation: Christians appear to be saying different things, but are often still imagining the same world.

This chapter prepares the ground for the next two. Before examining specific hijacked terms such as wrath, propitiation, atonement, and justice, and before exploring why translation itself is never neutral, we must first expose the deeper problem: **unchallenged assumptions that outlive the words that once carried them**.

## The Difference Between Words and Worlds

Words do not exist in isolation. They belong to **worlds of meaning**—networks of assumptions about God, humanity, sin, justice, and salvation. When a word is spoken, it does not merely communicate a definition; it invokes a framework.

Two people may use the same term—justice, wrath, atonement, faith—while imagining entirely different realities.

One may imagine a courtroom.  
Another a temple.  
Another a battlefield.  
Another a hospital.

The disagreement is not lexical. It is **cosmological**.

When debates stall, it is often because both sides believe the disagreement is about definitions, when it is actually about **the world the definition presupposes**.

## How Theological Frameworks Persist

Frameworks are rarely argued into existence. They are inherited.

Most Christians do not consciously choose a legal or penal model of salvation. They receive it implicitly through catechisms, sermon structures, evangelistic scripts, gospel summaries, and discipleship language.

Once received, the framework becomes invisible. Scripture is read through it, questions are asked from within it, and alternative readings feel immediately suspect—not because they are weak, but because they sound foreign.

This is how assumptions survive even when their original vocabulary is abandoned.

## When Old Ideas Put On New Clothes

This pattern appears repeatedly:

- Punishment becomes consequence  
- Legal guilt becomes relational brokenness  
- Penalty becomes cost  
- Appeasement becomes satisfaction  

At the surface level, the language appears softer, more biblical, and more relational. But beneath the surface, the same logic often remains:

- God must be satisfied  
- A debt must be paid  
- A problem must be resolved before relationship can be restored  

The words have changed. The assumptions have not.

This is not reform. It is **rebranding**.

## The Unquestioned Center: Order Before Life

One of the most persistent assumptions in Western theology is this:

> God’s primary problem is the violation of order, not the corruption of life.

Once this assumption is in place, everything else follows naturally:

- Justice must be satisfied before healing can occur  
- Wrath must be addressed before reconciliation is possible  
- Death becomes punishment rather than enemy  
- Salvation becomes legal resolution rather than liberation  

Even when the language shifts toward participation, union, or restoration, this assumption quietly governs the logic.

The early church did not begin here.

They began with **death as corruption**, **sin as bondage**, and **salvation as restoration to life**.

## Why This Matters More Than Definitions

If the disagreement were merely about words, dictionaries could resolve it. But dictionaries cannot adjudicate between worlds.

This is why debates over atonement, baptism, faith, and judgment often feel circular. Each side appeals to Scripture, each uses biblical language, and yet neither persuades the other.

They are not disagreeing over verses.

They are disagreeing over:

- What kind of problem salvation addresses  
- What kind of world Scripture describes  
- What kind of God is revealed  

Until those assumptions are surfaced, arguments remain misaligned.

## The Cost of Unexamined Assumptions

When assumptions go unchallenged, several pastoral consequences follow:

- Faith becomes anxiety-driven rather than participatory  
- Salvation becomes fragile, dependent on correct legal standing  
- Discipleship becomes self-management rather than transformation  
- Death becomes meaningful, rather than something to be destroyed  

Most importantly, Christ’s work is subtly reframed.

He no longer comes primarily to defeat death and restore life, but to manage a problem about God before addressing the problem of humanity.

This inversion is rarely stated explicitly. It is simply assumed.

---

## Why Scripture Alone Does Not Settle This

Appealing to Scripture does not automatically resolve framework disagreements, because Scripture itself must be imagined.

Is the controlling image:

- Courtroom or temple?  
- Sentence or surgery?  
- Transaction or transformation?  
- Substitution or participation?  

Scripture contains multiple metaphors, but it does not treat them as equal. Some are explanatory. Others are illustrative.

The problem arises when one metaphor is elevated to the governing framework and all others are forced to conform to it.

---

## Clearing the Ground

This chapter is intentionally diagnostic, not corrective.

Its purpose is to help the reader recognize when disagreements are not about what words mean, but about what world they assume.

Only once that ground is cleared can we responsibly examine:

- How specific theological words have been redefined  
- How translation choices reinforce certain frameworks  
- How Scripture sounds different when read from a different starting point  

The next chapters will take up those tasks directly.

## Conclusion: Hearing What We Are Actually Saying

Words change easily. Assumptions do not.

If theology is to be genuinely reformed rather than cosmetically adjusted, it must interrogate not only its vocabulary, but its imagination.

Before asking whether a term is biblical, we must ask:

- What problem does this term assume?  
- What kind of God does it imagine?  
- What kind of salvation does it require?  

Until those questions are faced, theological debates will continue to generate heat without light.

The issue is not that Christians are using the wrong words.

It is that they are often using **new words to protect old worlds**.
