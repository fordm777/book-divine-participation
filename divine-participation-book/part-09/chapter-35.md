# Chapter 35 — Common Questions, Familiar Words, and Misheard Meanings

By this point in the book, many disagreements have already been resolved—not because every verse has been individually addressed, but because the *framework itself* has shifted. When death is understood as dominion rather than punishment, when salvation is understood as rescue rather than transaction, and when Christ's work is understood as participation rather than legal substitution, many objections simply lose their force.

Still, certain questions persist. Not because Scripture is unclear, but because familiar biblical words are often heard through modern categories foreign to the world in which they were spoken. This chapter addresses several of those common questions—not to reopen earlier debates, but to clarify how Scripture itself uses its language.

What follows is not a defense against critics, but a translation for readers who want to hear Scripture on its own terms.

## Q: Doesn't "redeemed" mean a price was paid?

This question is understandable, especially in modern Christian usage where *redemption* is often framed as a financial or legal transaction. But this understanding owes more to later theological developments than to Scripture itself.

In the Old Testament, redemption language is most clearly defined by the Exodus. God declares that He has **redeemed Israel from bondage in Egypt**. Yet no payment is made to Pharaoh. No transaction is negotiated. Israel is not purchased through exchange. They are **rescued** through power, judgment, and deliverance.

Redemption, in Scripture, names liberation from bondage, not payment to a rightful owner.

This aligns with older English usage as well. Historically, *redeem* carried the sense of **recovering, rescuing, or reclaiming** something that had fallen into captivity or loss. The word did not inherently imply a financial exchange.

When the New Testament speaks of redemption, it continues this Exodus-shaped logic. Humanity is redeemed from slavery to sin and death—not by satisfying a debt ledger, but by being brought out from under a dominion that enslaved them.

Redemption is not primarily about what is paid. It is about **who now owns**.

## Q: What about "ransom" and "bought with a price" language?

Ransom language functions similarly. A ransom is what **frees captives**. Scripture consistently emphasizes the result of ransom—release from bondage—while remaining notably silent about *to whom* such a ransom is paid.

This silence is not accidental. The biblical concern is not identifying a recipient, but announcing liberation.

Likewise, when Paul says believers were "bought with a price," the point is not to construct a commercial metaphor, but to establish **transfer of ownership**. What once belonged to sin, death, and the devil now belongs to God.

This is crucial. Forgiveness in Scripture is not merely the cancellation of guilt. It presupposes a **change in lordship**. A slave is not forgiven into freedom while remaining owned by the same master. Ownership must change.

Salvation, then, is not a declaration issued while bondage remains intact. It is emancipation. Only once dominion has been broken can forgiveness be meaningfully spoken.

## Q: What does it mean that Christ "bore" or "carried" our sins?

This language is frequently assumed to mean that Christ absorbed punishment in our place. But Scripture itself uses *bearing* language differently.

To "bear" sin in biblical usage does not mean to be punished instead of someone else. It means to **carry, remove, deal with, or take responsibility for resolving** the problem.

Priests "bear" the sins of the people by dealing with them sacrificially. Scapegoats "bear" sins by carrying them away from the community. Israel "bears" its sins by living under the consequences of covenant breach.

In none of these cases does *bearing* require penal substitution.

When the New Testament says Christ bore our sins, it is speaking in this priestly and sacrificial register. Christ enters fully into the human condition under sin and death and **carries it through death itself**, removing its claim and power.

He does not stand apart from humanity and receive punishment instead. He stands *with* humanity, entering the depth of the problem in order to exhaust it.

---

## Q: What does "wrath" mean if God is not punishing?

Modern theology often treats *wrath* as shorthand for retributive punishment. Scripture does not.

Biblically, wrath frequently names what happens when God **hands people over** to the consequences of covenant breach—withdrawal of protection, exposure to destruction, or removal from life-giving presence. This is relational and covenantal language, not courtroom sentencing.

As discussed earlier (see Chapter 21), many theological words have been **hijacked**, redefined through later legal frameworks that flatten their original meaning. Wrath is one of them.

Wrath is not God losing control. It is God allowing corrupting forces to run their course when covenant is rejected. This is why wrath is often described in terms of exile, uncleanness, and death's reign rather than legal punishment.

---

## Q: If God could forgive, why did Jesus have to die?

Because the problem was never God's willingness to forgive.

The problem was death's dominion.

Death is not talked away. It is not ignored. It is not forgiven out of existence. Death is **entered, confronted, and defeated**. Christ truly enters death, defeats it from within, and only later—at the resurrection of all things—will death be fully destroyed.

Forgiveness without liberation leaves bondage intact. Christ does not merely announce pardon. He breaks the power that held humanity captive so forgiveness can actually be lived.

---

## Q: Isn't this just "Christus Victor"?

Many people treat *Christus Victor* as an atonement model alongside others. Historically, it is not an atonement theory at all. It is a **victory announcement**.

As discussed in Chapter 8, atonement concerns cleansing, reconciliation, and restored communion—not merely conflict imagery. Victory over death and the powers flows from Christ's participation in humanity, not from an alternative legal mechanism.

Christ does not defeat death externally like a warrior overpowering an enemy. He defeats it by **entering it**, exhausting it, and rising beyond it. Victory is the result of participation, not a competing explanation of atonement.

---

## Q: Is Communion just symbolic remembrance?

Many churches have reduced Communion to mental recall: *remember what Jesus did*. Scripture presents something far richer.

Paul explicitly connects the cup and the bread to **participation**: participation in Christ's blood and body (1 Corinthians 10). This mirrors Old Testament participation offerings, where worshipers shared a meal in God's presence as an expression of restored communion.

Communion is not transubstantiation, but neither is it bare symbolism. It is **real participation** in the life of the risen Christ. To reduce it to remembrance alone is to sever it from the participatory logic that runs through Scripture.

Christian worship is not merely reflective. It is communal and participatory.

## Q: Does Scripture teach irresistible grace?

The idea that grace cannot be resisted is often asserted rather than demonstrated. Appeals usually focus on passages such as John 6:44, yet Scripture consistently depicts people resisting God's call, grieving the Spirit, and rejecting grace.

Drawing someone does not negate their capacity to refuse. Scripture portrays grace as powerful, persuasive, and life-giving—but not coercive. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative in which humanity is enslaved yet capable of responding when liberated.

Irresistible grace is not required by Scripture. It is required by determinism.

## Q: Isn't choosing or participating just "saving yourself"?

This objection is common, especially within Calvinist frameworks, where any emphasis on human response is quickly labeled as self-salvation. But this framing fundamentally misunderstands what Scripture means by choosing, responding, or participating.

In Scripture, the person being saved is not rescuing themselves. They are **dying**.

The controlling image is Exodus.

Before Israel ever entered covenant at Sinai, before law, before stipulations, before national identity was formalized, they were still slaves in Egypt—under legitimate dominion. Pharaoh truly owned them. They could not free themselves, overthrow their master, or escape by moral effort.

What, then, were they called to do?

They were called to **mark themselves with death**—the blood of the lamb. This was not an act of self-rescue. It was an act of trustful submission to a deliverance they could not accomplish. The blood did not empower them to escape Egypt. It marked them out *for* rescue.

Only after this did God act decisively:
- He struck Egypt
- He broke Pharaoh's power
- He brought Israel out
- He led them through the sea and the cloud—Scripture's own baptism imagery

Israel did not save itself by choosing the lamb. They chose to **die under God's promise**, and God alone performed the deliverance.

This order matters.

The covenant at Sinai did not begin in Egypt. It began **after redemption**, not before it. Yet many covenantal systems reverse this logic, reading later covenant categories back into Egypt and treating Israel as if they were already covenant members while enslaved.

Scripture does not do this.

Participation, then, is not self-salvation. It is **consent to die out of one dominion and into another**. A drowning person who stops resisting and allows themselves to be pulled from the water is not saving themselves. Neither is a slave who steps through an opened gate claiming credit for liberation.

Calvinist objections often assume that unless God acts *without* human response, salvation becomes human achievement. Scripture assumes the opposite: that God's saving action **creates the possibility of response**, and that response is the means by which people pass from death into life.

Participation is not competition with grace. It is grace taking effect.

To accuse participation of being "saving yourself" is to mistake dying for climb

## Conclusion: Hearing Scripture Clearly Again

Most of these questions persist not because Scripture is unclear, but because words have been asked to do work they were never meant to do. When biblical language is reinserted into its covenantal, participatory, and embodied world, much of the tension dissolves.

This book has not attempted to discard familiar language, but to hear it rightly. When that happens, the story regains coherence. Salvation is no longer a legal fiction, death is no longer divine punishment, and forgiveness is no longer abstract.

What emerges instead is a gospel of rescue, liberation, participation, and life—one that does not minimize sin, but actually defeats it.
