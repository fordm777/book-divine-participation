# Chapter 30 — Baptism Without Water: The Strongest Case

## Introduction: The Question at Hand

Chapter 14 argued that baptism is the concrete, covenantal moment where believers **enter** Christ’s death and resurrection **by faith**, enacted in water and effected by the Spirit.

Yet a large portion of modern Christianity holds that water baptism is either symbolic-only, non-essential, or a secondary witness to an inward, spiritual baptism that has already occurred. This view is not marginal. It is widely held by sincere Christians who love Scripture and are deeply concerned to protect the gospel of grace.

For that reason, this chapter does not caricature or dismiss the position. It presents the strongest version of the case **on its own terms**, not merely listing verses, but exposing the *framework* that makes those verses persuasive.

Because the real disagreement is not finally about baptism.  
It is about what salvation itself is.

## The Core Concern Driving the View

The modern resistance to water baptism as necessary is almost never rooted in a rejection of obedience. It is rooted in fear—often justified fear—of two things:

1. **Works-righteousness**  
   If baptism is required, it can sound as though salvation depends on something we do.

2. **Sacramental mechanism**  
   If baptism “saves,” it can sound as though water works automatically, apart from faith.

Both concerns arise from real historical abuses. They deserve to be taken seriously. But fear can also cause a framework shift that quietly changes the nature of salvation itself.

## Why the Case Against Water Baptism Feels Compelling

When stated carefully, the strongest modern case for baptism as symbolic or non-essential usually rests on several converging claims.

### Salvation is by faith alone

Texts such as Romans 3–5, Galatians, and Ephesians 2:8–9 are read to establish a clean sequence:

1. Hear the gospel  
2. Believe  
3. Are saved  
4. Obey (including baptism)

Within this model, baptism is obedience *after* salvation, not the means by which faith enters salvation.

### Spirit baptism is treated as the “one baptism”

Passages like 1 Corinthians 12:13 and Ephesians 4:5 are interpreted to mean that the true baptism is spiritual and inward, with water functioning only as a sign of that deeper reality.

### Exceptional cases appear decisive

The thief on the cross is frequently cited: he was promised paradise without baptism. From this it is inferred that baptism cannot be essential in principle.

### Paul appears to minimize baptism

In 1 Corinthians 1:17, Paul says, “Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel.” This is taken to mean that baptism is secondary to the gospel itself.

### Cornelius received the Spirit before baptism

Acts 10 is often treated as proof that salvation precedes baptism, since the Spirit falls before water is applied.

### Many salvation texts mention belief but not baptism

Jesus often promises life to those who believe, especially in John’s Gospel. Paul often calls people to faith and confession without immediately mentioning baptism. This silence is taken as evidence that baptism cannot be necessary.

### Pastoral concern presses hardest

What about the believer who dies before baptism?  
What about those who lack opportunity?

To preserve assurance, many conclude that baptism cannot be essential, because God can and does save apart from it in exceptional cases.

These arguments are not careless. They arise from a sincere desire to guard grace, protect assurance, and avoid superstition.

## The Earliest Christian Baseline

Before responding to later theological developments, it matters to establish a baseline.

The earliest Christian writers—apostolic and ante-Nicene—did not treat water baptism as optional, symbolic-only, or secondary. They assumed it as the ordinary point of entry into Christian life, consistently associating it with:

- cleansing from sins,
- new birth,
- reception of the Spirit,
- renunciation of former dominion,
- entrance into the Church.

They did not frame baptism as competing with faith. They framed it as **faith’s embodied enactment**.

This does not settle every later debate, but it establishes an important fact: the modern spiritual-only view is **not** the apostolic default.

## The First Rejection of Water Baptism: Gnostic Assumptions

Historically, the earliest groups to deny the necessity or efficacy of water baptism were **gnostic or gnostic-adjacent movements**.

Their objection was not fear of works. It was distrust of matter itself. Salvation was conceived as escape from embodiment through knowledge or illumination. Within that worldview, water could not function as a means of salvation because the material order was suspect.

Early Christian writers repeatedly connect the denial of water baptism with a denial of:
- the goodness of creation,
- the incarnation,
- salvation enacted within bodily life.

This matters because it shows that the earliest attempt to “spiritualize” baptism did not arise from a grace-centered concern, but from an ontology that rejected embodied participation altogether.

---

## How the Modern View Actually Developed

The modern spiritual-only position does not descend from gnosticism. It emerges later, under different pressures.

### Reformation fear of sacerdotalism

In reacting against real sacramental abuses, the Reformers emphasized faith and Christ’s sufficiency. Over time, this defensive posture sometimes led to suspicion of any concrete means that appeared to mediate salvation.

### Legal and forensic priority

As salvation became framed primarily as a legal verdict, death became metaphorical rather than enacted. Baptism, no longer needed to locate death, was redefined as a sign of a verdict already rendered.

### Anxiety about “means”

In traditions where regeneration is placed prior to any embodied response, baptism cannot function as transition. It must be confirmation. The result is an increasingly abstract salvation.

### Revivalist decision theology

As conversion became centered on immediate decisions and verbal confessions, baptism became easier to delay. Delay normalized. Normalization produced optionality.

## The Real Disagreement Beneath the Debate

When the strongest case against water baptism is examined carefully, something crucial becomes visible.

The disagreement is not finally about proof texts.

It is about **what salvation is**.

### Two Different Questions Being Asked

One side is asking:

> **How is guilt removed?**

The other is asking:

> **How is dominion escaped?**

Once this is seen, the debate begins to make sense.

## Framework Comparison: What Is Really at Stake

| Question | Legal / Forensic Framework | Covenantal / Participatory Framework |
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| What is salvation? | A verdict declared | A passage entered |
| Primary image | Courtroom | Exodus / death / resurrection |
| What does faith do? | Assents | Entrusts and obeys |
| Faith is | Cognitive belief | Relational allegiance |
| Role of the body | Symbolic | Participatory |
| What can matter do? | Point to reality | Serve as means |
| How is death handled? | Christ dies instead of us | Christ dies so we can die with Him |
| Where does death occur? | Metaphorically | Concretely |
| What is baptism? | Symbol of salvation | Entry into death and life |
| Faith’s relation to baptism | Replaces it | Expresses itself through it |
| View of obedience | After salvation | Mode of entering salvation |
| Time of salvation | Instant verdict | Enacted transition |
| Primary fear | Works-righteousness | Avoidance of death |
| What is lost if wrong? | Assurance | Participation |

This table exposes why the debate persists. The two sides are often answering different questions, using different metaphors, and guarding different perceived dangers.

## Why Baptism Becomes the Fault Line

Baptism sits precisely at the intersection of:

- faith and obedience,
- spirit and body,
- declaration and enactment,
- promise and participation.

If salvation is primarily a verdict, baptism will inevitably become symbolic.

If salvation is a passage through death into life, baptism will inevitably be the place where that passage is entered **by faith**.

This is why the apostolic writings feel no tension modern readers feel. They are not asking whether baptism adds to grace. They are describing **how grace is entered**.

---

## Conclusion: Where the Question Must Be Settled

The disagreement over baptism is not finally about water.

It is about whether salvation is something **declared about us** or something **enacted upon us**.

Until that question is faced, the debate will never be resolved—not because Scripture is unclear, but because it is being asked to answer a question it was never written to address.

The gospel does not merely announce forgiveness.  
It announces deliverance.

And deliverance, in Scripture, is not received by verdict alone, but by **passing through death into life**.

If salvation is a passage, it must have an entrance.  
If death is real, it must occur somewhere.  
If faith is trust, it must act.

The apostolic witness locates that passage, that death, and that act of faith in baptism.

Not as a work.  
Not as magic.  
But as the place where faith finally stops circling death—and enters it.
