# Chapter 29 — Renewed Covenant Theology: The Strongest Biblical Case

## Introduction: Why This View Deserves a Fair Hearing

Among Christians who take Scripture seriously, there are many who believe that the so-called “New Covenant” is not a replacement of the Sinai covenant, but its **renewal**. According to this view, God does not abandon covenants He has made. He restores them. The covenant remains the same in essence, though its administration, location, or internalization changes.

This position is not shallow, careless, or irreverent. It often arises from a deep respect for Scripture, for Israel, and for the faithfulness of God. It seeks to preserve continuity rather than rupture, unity rather than division. For this reason, it deserves to be presented **at its strongest**, not dismissed through caricature.

This chapter will present the renewed-covenant position as fairly as possible, identify why it matters, and then examine whether it can account for the full weight of the biblical witness—particularly the language of death, release, and transfer explored earlier in this work.

## The Renewed Covenant Position: Stated in Its Strongest Form

At its strongest, renewed-covenant theology makes several interlocking claims.

### 1. God Does Not Abandon His Covenants

God is faithful. What He establishes, He keeps. From this perspective, it would be inconsistent with God’s character to terminate a covenant He Himself instituted. Restoration, not replacement, better reflects divine faithfulness.

The covenant at Sinai, therefore, is not viewed as defective in itself. The problem lay with the people, not the covenant.

### 2. Jeremiah 31 Promises Restoration, Not Replacement

Jeremiah 31 explicitly addresses **the house of Israel and the house of Judah**. The promise of a “new covenant” is therefore read as a promise of national and spiritual restoration, not the introduction of a fundamentally different covenantal structure.

In this reading, “new” refers to renewed relationship, renewed obedience, and renewed faithfulness—especially through the law being written on the heart rather than imposed externally.

### 3. The Torah Remains Good and Binding in Principle

The law is holy, just, and good. Jesus did not come to abolish it, but to fulfill it. Therefore, the covenant itself does not need to die. What is required is transformed hearts capable of faithful obedience.

The renewed covenant supplies what was missing: internal transformation rather than external command.

### 4. “New” Language Can Be Functional Rather Than Ontological

In Scripture, “new” does not always mean “brand-new in kind.” It can also refer to restoration, renewal, or fresh expression. On this reading, the covenant is new in experience and effect, but continuous in identity.

This preserves a unified covenantal storyline rather than dividing history into incompatible eras.

### 5. Continuity Safeguards God’s Character and Israel’s Role

A renewed covenant framework resists supersessionism and affirms Israel’s ongoing place in God’s purposes. Gentiles are not given a separate covenant, but are grafted into Israel’s restored covenant life.

This approach feels faithful, rooted, and protective of biblical continuity.

## Why This View Feels Faithful — and Why It Matters

Renewed-covenant theology is compelling for reasons that are not merely academic.

It:
- Honors Israel’s role in salvation history  
- Emphasizes continuity across Scripture  
- Resists anti-Jewish interpretations  
- Preserves moral seriousness and obedience  
- Avoids portraying God as abandoning prior commitments  

For many believers, this framework provides stability and coherence. It answers fears that Christianity has severed itself from its own roots. It feels grounded and responsible.

Because of this, the renewed-covenant position **matters deeply**. It shapes how believers understand obedience, freedom, baptism, sanctification, and even the meaning of salvation itself.

The question, therefore, is not whether this view is sincere. The question is whether it can account for **all** that Scripture says.

---

## The Structural Question the Renewed Covenant Must Answer

The renewed-covenant model must answer a central question:

**If the covenant is renewed rather than ended, how does Scripture explain release from binding covenant authority?**

This is not a lexical question about words. It is a **jurisdictional** question.

Covenants bind. Authority persists as long as jurisdiction persists. Renewal, by definition, preserves jurisdiction. Yet Scripture repeatedly speaks of:
- release  
- freedom  
- deliverance  
- transfer  
- death  

Any model of covenant continuity must account for these realities.

---

## Covenant Authority and the Problem of Jurisdiction

Throughout Scripture, covenant authority is tied to life. A covenant binds the living. Obligation persists as long as the covenant remains operative over its subjects.

If the covenant is renewed:
- jurisdiction remains intact  
- authority continues  
- obligation persists  

But Paul’s argument in Romans 7 explicitly grounds release **not in improvement, but in death**.

> “The law has dominion over a person as long as he lives.”

This is not metaphorical language. It is legal and covenantal. As long as life persists, authority persists. Renewal does not change this. Only death does.

---

## Why Death Becomes Unavoidable

Scripture does not speak of covenant transition primarily in the language of repair or restoration. It speaks in the language of:
- death  
- burial  
- release  
- resurrection  
- new creation  

Romans 7 does not say the covenant was refreshed. It says believers **became dead to the law**. Hebrews does not say the covenant was updated. It says the first was made old and was vanishing away.

If the covenant is merely renewed, then death language must be reinterpreted as illustrative rather than operative. But Scripture never treats it that way.

Death is not decoration. It is the mechanism.

## What Is Gained — and What Is Lost — If the Covenant Is Only Renewed

A renewed-covenant framework does preserve important truths. But it also changes the shape of salvation in subtle ways.

### What Is Gained

- Strong continuity with Israel  
- Emphasis on obedience and holiness  
- Resistance to antinomianism  
- Respect for Torah as God’s good gift  

These are not small gains.

### What Is Lost

However, if the covenant is only renewed:

- Death risks becoming symbolic rather than decisive  
- Baptism risks becoming representational rather than participatory  
- Release risks becoming psychological rather than ontological  
- Freedom risks being redefined as improved obedience  
- Romans 7’s jurisdictional logic loses force  
- Resurrection risks becoming additive rather than transformative  

The issue is not sincerity. The issue is **what salvation actually accomplishes**.

---

## Why This Is Not an Academic Disagreement

This question matters because it shapes lived experience.

If covenant authority is renewed rather than ended:
- believers may struggle endlessly under obligation  
- death language becomes foreign or minimized  
- baptism is reduced to testimony  
- sanctification becomes effort-driven  
- freedom becomes conditional rather than real  

If covenant authority truly ends through death:
- release becomes ontological  
- obedience flows from new life  
- baptism marks real transfer  
- sanctification becomes participation  
- freedom is grounded, not aspirational  

These are not theoretical differences. They affect how people live, struggle, and hope.

## Conclusion: What the New Covenant Claims That Renewal Cannot

The renewed-covenant position offers continuity, faithfulness, and respect for Scripture. But it struggles to account for one unavoidable reality: **death**.

Scripture does not present covenant transition as repair. It presents it as termination followed by resurrection. The law remains holy. The covenant remains meaningful. But its authority ends where death occurs.

The New Covenant does not discard the old by force. It brings it to its lawful end through death—so that resurrection life may truly begin.

This is not loss. It is fulfillment.

Covenant death is not failure.  
It is release.  

And only where release occurs can true life begin.
