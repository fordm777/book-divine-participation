# Chapter 41 — Renewed Covenant Theology: The Strongest Biblical Case

## Introduction: Why This Question Matters

Throughout this book, we have presented Scripture as pointing toward a **new covenant**, rather than a renewed one. We have traced how death functions as the boundary of covenant authority, how release precedes life, and how salvation is consistently framed as participation in Christ’s death and resurrection rather than improvement of an existing state.

At the same time, there is a view held by many sincere believers that understands the work of Christ not as inaugurating a fundamentally new covenant, but as **renewing, restoring, and internalizing** the covenant God made with Israel. This view—often called renewed covenant theology—arises from a desire to honor God’s faithfulness, preserve continuity across Scripture, resist lawlessness, and take seriously the words and practices of Jesus and the apostles.

Because of this, it deserves careful and fair presentation. This chapter sets out the renewed-covenant position at its strongest, explores why it is compelling, and then considers where tension emerges when it is set alongside the full biblical witness—particularly the framework of **purification, death, and indwelling** that governs Acts, Paul’s letters, and the apostolic gospel as a whole.

## The Renewed Covenant Position at Its Strongest

### 1. Prophetic Language Emphasizes Restoration

Renewed covenant theology draws heavily from the prophetic literature, which consistently speaks in terms of **restoration rather than replacement**.

Jeremiah’s promise of a “new covenant” (Jeremiah 31:31–34) appears within a context of return from exile. The covenant is explicitly with Israel and Judah. The law is not discarded but written on hearts. The covenant formula—“I will be their God, and they shall be my people”—remains unchanged.

Likewise, Ezekiel’s vision focuses on transformation rather than abolition:

> “I will sprinkle clean water upon you… I will give you a new heart… and cause you to walk in my statutes.” (Ezekiel 36:25–27)

The emphasis is on cleansing, renewal of the heart, and Spirit-enabled obedience. From this perspective, the covenant itself remains intact; what changes is the condition of the people within it.

Hosea’s marriage imagery reinforces this reading. Despite Israel’s unfaithfulness, God speaks of betrothing her again. The relationship is healed, not replaced. The same bride is restored.

### 2. God’s Promises to Israel Remain Firm

A second pillar of renewed covenant theology is the conviction that God’s promises are irrevocable.

The Abrahamic covenant is called “everlasting.” Paul insists that God has not cast away his people (Romans 11:1–2) and describes Gentiles as grafted into Israel’s olive tree rather than planted into a different one (Romans 11:17–24).

From this perspective, covenant continuity safeguards God’s faithfulness. Any account of Christ’s work must preserve Israel’s election rather than nullify it.

---

### 3. Jesus Affirms the Law and the Prophets

Jesus’ own words carry significant weight:

> “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.” (Matthew 5:17)

Renewed covenant theology understands fulfillment as bringing Torah to its intended depth rather than setting it aside. Jesus keeps the law, teaches from it, and summarizes it through love of God and neighbor. Torah is not negated; it is rightly understood.

---

### 4. Apostolic Practice Appears Continuous

The apostles, including Paul, continue to participate in Jewish life after the resurrection. Acts depicts temple worship, feast observance, vows, and purification rituals. Paul insists he has not violated the law or the temple.

Renewed covenant theology often reads Paul’s letters in light of this practice, understanding his polemic as directed against Torah as a means of justification, not against Torah as a way of life.

## Acts 15: A Crucial Test Case

Acts 15 is central to renewed and dual-covenant readings. The Jerusalem Council addresses whether Gentile believers must be circumcised and take on the full yoke of the Mosaic law.

The council answers decisively: they must not.

Yet Gentiles are given four prohibitions:

- abstaining from things polluted by idols  
- abstaining from blood  
- abstaining from things strangled  
- abstaining from sexual immorality  

These are not arbitrary moral rules. They correspond directly to **categories of bodily defilement** associated with pagan worship and Gentile life.

For renewed-covenant readers, this is compelling. The apostles do not dismiss purity concerns. They draw directly from Torah categories. They require Gentiles to live in ways compatible with holiness.

At the same time, the decision is carefully limited. Circumcision is not required. Sabbath observance is not mandated. Gentiles are not placed under the jurisdiction of the Mosaic covenant. The focus is not covenant entry, but **purity of life and shared fellowship**.

This raises an important question: *what kind of framework best explains this decision?*

## Acts 15 Read Through Paul’s Teaching in 1 Corinthians

The purification logic of Acts 15 becomes clearer when read alongside Paul’s teaching in 1 Corinthians. As Paul addresses the same categories of concern—idolatry, blood, sexual immorality, and participation—he consistently frames them in terms of **temple cleanness**. What is striking is not that concern for holiness disappears, but that it is relocated. Language once used to guard the sanctity of a physical sanctuary is now applied to the **body itself**, because, as Paul goes on to explain, the body has become the dwelling place of God’s Spirit. Holiness has not diminished; the location of God’s presence has changed.

### Food Offered to Idols (1 Corinthians 8–10)

Paul acknowledges that idols have no real existence. Yet participation in idol feasts is not neutral. Such participation involves communion and produces contamination.

> “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils.” (1 Corinthians 10:21)

The concern is not covenant legality, but **contamination through participation**.

### Blood and Participation

Paul’s language surrounding the cup and the body of Christ emphasizes that participation is real and embodied. What enters the body matters, because the body itself is now claimed by Christ. Participation joins the believer not only to Christ, but to whatever power is encountered at the table.

### Sexual Immorality (1 Corinthians 5–6)

Paul’s strongest warnings concern sexual immorality, and his reasoning is explicitly purification-oriented.

> “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?”  
> “He that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.”

Sexual immorality is not framed primarily as law-breaking, but as desecration of what has been claimed as holy.

### The Body as Temple

Paul states the underlying reality plainly:

> “Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.”

This becomes the controlling category. The Spirit dwells in what has been cleansed. Contamination does not primarily threaten legal standing, but the integrity of indwelling presence.

Read in this light, Acts 15 does not function as renewed covenant legislation. It operates as a **purification framework**, governing how bodies formerly shaped by idolatry may now participate in a holy community in which God dwells.

## A Central Question Emerges

At this point, a central question emerges for the renewed-covenant position:

**How does renewal alone account for Scripture’s insistence that death is the mechanism of release from covenant authority?**

Paul states the principle clearly:

> “The law has dominion over a person as long as he lives.” (Romans 7:1)

Covenant authority persists as long as jurisdiction persists. Renewal repairs what exists; it does not end jurisdiction. Yet Paul repeatedly describes salvation in terms of **death, release, and transfer**.

This is where tension begins to surface.

---

## Why Death Becomes Decisive

Romans 6–7 does not frame covenant transition as restoration within the same bond, but as release through death followed by new union.

- dying with Christ  
- burial  
- release from prior dominion  
- marriage to another  
- newness of life  

This is jurisdictional language, not merely experiential language.

Renewed covenant theology explains transformation well. It explains continuity well. But it struggles to explain why **death**, rather than renewal, is presented as the decisive boundary.

If covenant authority remains continuous, death cannot function as release.  
If death functions as release, renewal alone cannot account for the transition.

---

## Pastoral Consequences of Missing the Purification Framework

When purification and cleansing are not the controlling categories, several patterns often emerge—sometimes unintentionally.

- Acts 15 becomes reduced to minimal ethics rather than bodily holiness  
- 1 Corinthians becomes moral exhortation rather than temple protection  
- Baptism becomes symbolic rather than participatory  
- Romans 7 becomes normalized as the Christian condition  
- Freedom becomes managed struggle rather than decisive release  

These outcomes are not inevitable, but they are common. They reflect what happens when death, cleansing, and indwelling are treated as metaphors rather than realities.

---

## Why Renewal and Penal Substitution Both Strain Here

Both renewed-covenant theology and penal substitution models often struggle at the same point—not because they agree, but because **neither places purification at the center**.

- Renewal emphasizes continuity but lacks a mechanism for release  
- Penal substitution emphasizes legal resolution but bypasses cleansing  
- Both tend to relocate the problem to guilt rather than contamination  
- Both struggle to integrate temple, body, and indwelling coherently  

Scripture, by contrast, consistently treats sin as something that **defiles**, not merely something that condemns.

---

## Conclusion: Why the Covenant Must Be New

Renewed covenant theology presents a serious and thoughtful reading of Scripture. It honors God’s faithfulness, takes Jesus’ words seriously, preserves continuity, and resists lawlessness.

At the same time, it encounters increasing strain when set alongside Scripture’s consistent insistence that **death precedes life**, **cleansing precedes indwelling**, and **release precedes obedience**.

Acts 15 and 1 Corinthians do not function as covenant-renewal texts. They function as purification texts. They assume bodies that must be cleansed because God now dwells within them.

Romans 6–7 does not describe improved covenant fidelity, but **release through death** and **union with another**.

This is why the covenant cannot merely be renewed.  
It must be **new**.

Not because God abandons his promises,  
but because only death can end bondage,  
only cleansing can prepare a dwelling place,  
and only resurrection can bring a people into life they could never produce.

The covenant is new because the people are new—  
cleansed, released, and indwelt.

And that is the logic that holds the whole witness of Scripture together.
