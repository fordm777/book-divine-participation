# Chapter 39 — Total Depravity: The Strongest Biblical Case

## Why Total Depravity Must Be Taken Seriously

Total Depravity is not a peripheral doctrine in Reformed theology. It is foundational. If humanity is not spiritually dead in the specific way Calvinism requires—namely, **ontologically incapable of responding to God**—then irresistible grace, regeneration preceding faith, and theological determinism lose their footing.

Because of this, Total Depravity deserves its strongest possible hearing.

Reformed theologians consistently point to **Romans 5** and **Ephesians 2** as their clearest biblical support. If Total Depravity is taught anywhere, it must be taught here.

But when these passages are read carefully and allowed to define their own categories, something decisive emerges:  
Paul speaks in the language of **dominion and bondage**, not ontology.

That distinction governs everything that follows.

## Dominion Language vs Ontological Claims

An **ontological claim** is a claim about *being*—about what something **is by nature**.

When Calvinism says humanity is “spiritually dead,” it usually means:
- the human will is nonfunctional toward God,
- the capacity to respond is absent,
- faith is impossible until regeneration occurs.

Those are **ontological claims**.

By contrast, **dominion language** describes rule and control:
- a power reigning over persons,
- slavery rather than non-existence,
- captivity rather than incapacity.

Paul consistently uses dominion language.

## Romans 5: Death Reigns, Humanity Does Not Cease

Romans 5:12–21 is the most sustained apostolic reflection on Adam, sin, death, and the human condition.

Paul writes:

> “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned…” (Romans 5:12)

The central problem is not inherited guilt or metaphysical inability.  
The problem is **the reign of death**.

Paul repeats this emphasis:
- “Death **reigned** from Adam to Moses” (v.14)
- “Many **died**” (v.15)
- “Death **exercised dominion**” (v.17)

This is not courtroom language.  
It is not ontological language.  
It is **dominion language**.

Death is a tyrant, not the substance of human nature.

### Death Rules Over People Who Still Act

During death’s reign:
- humans still sin,
- humans still respond,
- humans still believe, obey, resist, and rebel.

Paul does not describe humanity as spiritually inert. He describes humanity as **alive under a hostile power**.

That is why liberation—not secret regeneration—is the solution Paul advances.

## Ephesians 2: “Dead in Sins” Explained by Dominion

Ephesians 2 is often cited as decisive proof of ontological spiritual death:

> “You were dead in trespasses and sins…” (Ephesians 2:1)

But Paul immediately explains what this “deadness” looks like:

> “in which you once **walked**, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air…” (v.2)

Dead people do not walk.

Paul defines “dead in sins” as **enslavement**:
- ruled by the world,
- governed by hostile powers,
- driven by disordered desires.

This is dominion language, not ontology.

Reading verse 1 ontologically while verses 2–3 dominionally fractures Paul’s argument. Paul himself never makes that move.

### Sidebar: Ontology vs Dominion (Why the Difference Matters)

**Ontology** concerns *being*—what a person **is by nature**.  
An ontological claim says a person cannot respond because the capacity is absent.

**Dominion** concerns *rule*—what **controls or governs** a person.  
A dominion claim says a person acts under constraint or slavery.

Paul’s language of death is dominion language:
- death reigns,
- death enslaves,
- death must be defeated.

Calvinism tends to read these texts ontologically.  
Paul speaks covenantally and dominionally.

That difference determines whether salvation bypasses humanity or liberates humanity.

---

## The Internal Contradiction Created by Ontological Death

The ontological model introduces a problem Paul never has.

According to the Calvinist sequence:
1. Humans are already spiritually dead (ontologically)
2. God regenerates them so they can believe
3. They believe because they are now alive
4. They then “die with Christ”
5. They are made alive again in Christ

This yields an incoherent pattern:
**dead → alive → dead → alive**

Paul never teaches this.

## Dying with Christ in Baptism

Paul’s baptismal theology is explicit:

> “Do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His **death**?” (Romans 6:3)

Dying with Christ only makes sense if:
- humans are alive under death’s dominion,
- death is something that can be entered,
- death is something that can be passed through.

Paul does not say:
> “You discovered you were already dead.”

He says:
> “You **died** with Christ.”

If humans are already ontologically dead, baptism becomes symbolic theater rather than real participation.

## The Solution Scripture Gives: Death (Not a Work)

Scripture’s solution to death’s dominion is not bypassing death.  
It is **going through it**.

The person must die.

This death is not a work of the law.
It is not an achievement or contribution.
It is not something earned.

Death is the **end of self-rescue**.

To die with Christ is not to do something, but to **cease clinging to life under death’s reign** and to entrust oneself wholly to God’s act of resurrection.

This is why Paul can insist salvation is not by works while insisting participation in Christ’s death is necessary.

Dying is not a work.  
It is the surrender of all works.

## A Biblical Version of “Total Depravity”

If Scripture defines the problem, a biblical version of total depravity would sound like this:

- Humanity is totally under the dominion of death  
- Humanity is totally unable to free itself  
- Humanity is totally corrupted by mortality and fear  
- Humanity requires divine rescue  

But Scripture does *not* say:
- humanity is incapable of response,
- faith is impossible prior to regeneration,
- humans are ontologically dead in their being.

That is a later theological move, not an apostolic one.

## Common Calvinist Objection: “But Slaves Can’t Free Themselves”

A common response is:

> “If humans are enslaved to death, they still cannot respond. Slavery implies inability.”

This objection fails on Paul’s own terms.

Slavery does not mean non-existence.  
It means **lack of self-liberation**.

Throughout Scripture:
- slaves hear commands,
- captives cry out,
- prisoners respond to deliverance.

What slaves cannot do is **free themselves**.

Paul never says faith is self-rescue.  
He says faith is **receiving rescue**.

Responding to liberation is not the same as producing liberation.

## A Brief Historical Turning Point: Augustine

The shift from dominion language to ontological incapacity does not come from the apostles or the Ante-Nicene Fathers. It develops gradually and becomes pronounced in Augustine’s later anti-Pelagian writings.

Responding to real errors, Augustine increasingly framed the fall as resulting in a will unable to turn toward God without prior grace. Death was no longer primarily a reigning power to be destroyed, but an internal condition of inability.

This was not yet full Calvinism, but it laid its groundwork.

Earlier Christian writers consistently spoke of corruption, bondage, and mortality—not metaphysical non-response.

Recognizing this development allows Augustine to be taken seriously without treating him as apostolic.

## Conclusion: Dominion, Not Ontology

Romans 5 and Ephesians 2 do not teach Total Depravity as ontological inability.

They teach **total bondage to a reigning power**.

Paul’s solution is not secret regeneration before faith.  
It is union with Christ through death and resurrection.

Death is real.  
Bondage is real.  
Dominion is real.

And so is the call:

> “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” (Ephesians 5:14)

Dead things cannot awaken.  
Enslaved people can be freed.

And that difference changes the entire gospel.

## Why This Critique Is Different

Many critiques of Total Depravity already exist. Some come from Arminian or Wesleyan traditions, others from Eastern Christianity, others from modern biblical scholarship. Most agree that the Reformed account of human inability goes too far.

What distinguishes this critique is not the conclusion, but the **method**.

This chapter has not attempted to soften the human problem, reduce the seriousness of sin, or defend human autonomy. It has done the opposite. It has taken death, bondage, and corruption with full seriousness—exactly as Paul describes them.

The difference lies in **category**.

Most critiques of Total Depravity still accept its ontological framing and attempt to solve it by adding a mechanism: prevenient grace, enabling grace, partial regeneration, or some other divine intervention that restores capacity before faith. In those systems, humans remain incapable until something invisible happens first.

This chapter has refused that move.

Instead of asking how humans gain ability, it has asked a prior question:  
**What does Scripture mean by “death”?**

Paul’s answer is consistent and unavoidable: death is a **reigning power**, not a description of human non-being. Humanity is alive under domination, not erased in its capacity to respond.

Once that category is allowed to stand, the entire Pauline framework becomes coherent:
- death reigns,
- Christ enters death,
- believers die with Him,
- death’s dominion is broken,
- resurrection follows.

This critique does not attack Total Depravity from outside Paul’s argument.  
It allows Paul’s argument to complete itself.

## Death, Not Bypass

Another difference is where this chapter places the solution.

Many systems—both Reformed and non-Reformed—ultimately solve the problem of death by **bypassing it**. Life is given first, then death-language is reinterpreted metaphorically.

Paul never does this.

For Paul, the solution to death is not secret regeneration prior to faith.  
The solution is **death itself**—shared with Christ.

This death is not a work. It is not an achievement. It is not a contribution. It is the end of self-rescue and the beginning of resurrection by God alone.

Any framework that renders dying with Christ redundant, symbolic, or chronologically incoherent has failed to preserve the structure of the gospel Paul actually preached.

## Letting the Apostolic Grammar Stand

This chapter does not claim novelty. The categories employed here—death as dominion, salvation as participation, resurrection as liberation—are ancient. They are visible in Scripture itself and echoed throughout the early church.

What is unusual is allowing those categories to function **without being subordinated to later ontological frameworks**.

Rather than translating Paul into a different grammar, this chapter has attempted to let the apostolic grammar stand.

And once it does, the conclusion follows naturally:

Romans 5 and Ephesians 2 do not teach Total Depravity as ontological inability.  
They teach **total bondage to a reigning power**.

The gospel does not begin with bypassed death.  
It begins with dying—and ends with resurrection.

## Two Competing Progressions: Ontology vs Dominion

One of the clearest ways to see the difference between the Reformed account of Total Depravity and the apostolic account found in Paul is to compare how each framework understands the **starting point**, the **problem**, and the **solution**.

| Question | Reformed Ontological Framework | Apostolic Dominion Framework |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Starting condition** | Human beings begin **spiritually dead** in their being | Human beings begin **alive under the dominion of death** |
| **Nature of death** | Ontological inability (capacity is absent) | A reigning power or tyrant |
| **Human condition** | Will is nonfunctional toward God | Will is enslaved but operative |
| **Primary problem** | Inability to respond | Bondage requiring liberation |
| **Meaning of “dead in sins”** | Non-response due to spiritual non-life | Living under hostile rule |
| **Role of fear and mortality** | Secondary or incidental | Central (Hebrews 2:14–15) |
| **Solution required** | Regeneration before faith | Death with Christ followed by resurrection |
| **Order of salvation** | Alive → believe → die (symbolically) → live | Alive under death → die with Christ → live |
| **Meaning of baptism** | Sign following prior regeneration (not a death-event) | Participation in Christ’s death |
| **Is dying with Christ real?** | Redundant or metaphorical | Necessary and transformative |
| **Is death bypassed?** | Yes, functionally | No, death is entered |
| **Is dying a work?** | Not required, since the person is considered already dead | No—death is required and ends all works |
| **Final outcome** | Life granted **without dying with Christ** | Resurrection **through dying with Christ** |

The contrast is not whether Christ died, but whether the person must die with Him; Reformed ontology grants life prior to death-with-Christ, while Paul’s framework grants life only through it.

This difference has significant implications.

In the Reformed ontological framework, the person is already considered spiritually dead prior to regeneration, and then made alive so that faith may occur. Baptism therefore cannot function as a real death-event without introducing a contradiction—namely, that a person is made alive, then dies again, and is then made alive again. Reformed theology does not teach this sequence, and rightly avoids it.

As a result, baptism is treated as a sign that follows regeneration rather than as participation in Christ’s death.

In Paul’s framework, however, baptism must be a death-event, because the person is alive under death’s dominion. Dying with Christ is therefore not symbolic or redundant, but necessary. Resurrection follows death, not the other way around.

The issue is not whether Calvinists affirm baptism, but whether their ontological starting point allows baptism to mean what Paul says it means.


This comparison does not minimize the seriousness of sin or death. It highlights how differently Scripture and later theological systems **classify** the problem.

Paul does not begin with ontological non-existence.  
He begins with domination, slavery, and reign.

And because the problem is dominion, the solution is not bypass—but **participation, death, and resurrection**.

If spiritual death is treated as ontological and universal, then no one ever truly dies with Christ—only rises with Him—which quietly empties Paul’s death–burial–resurrection grammar of its meaning.

If Paul’s language of being “baptized into His death” is taken seriously as a real death-event, then an ontological “already dead” starting point creates a deeper incoherence.

In such a framework, people are said to be spiritually dead prior to Christ, but they have never died *with Christ*. Spiritual death in sin is treated as equivalent to participation in Christ’s death, even though Paul clearly distinguishes the two.

As a result, baptism cannot function as dying with Christ without implying that a person is made alive, then dies again, and is then made alive again—a sequence Reformed theology does not teach and rightly avoids.

To preserve coherence, baptism is therefore reclassified as participation only in Christ’s risen life, not in His death. But this means the believer never truly passes through Christ’s death at all, only receives its benefits.

The issue is not whether Christ died for sinners, but whether sinners ever die **with** Christ. Paul’s gospel insists that they must.

## Pastoral Closing: Waiting for Life or Entering Death?

One pastoral danger of the ontological framework is that it trains people to *wait* for a moment of life—an inward quickening that arrives suddenly and produces belief. When that moment comes, the person may sincerely conclude, “I am saved,” because belief is present.

But Paul’s question is not only, “Do you believe?” It is also: **Have you died with Christ?**

If the gospel is a transfer of dominion, then the passage into life is not merely mental assent or an internal sensation of being made alive. It is participation in Christ’s death and resurrection. The old life does not get managed, improved, or crowned with religious confidence. It **ends**.

This is why dying with Christ is not a work of the law. It is the end of works—the collapse of self-rescue, the burial of the old man, the surrender of every claim to establish life by effort, insight, or spiritual experience. Resurrection is God’s gift on the far side of death.

So the question is not meant to torment tender consciences. It is meant to clarify the gospel’s shape: if someone has never died with Christ, they may still be trying to live *toward* freedom rather than living *from* freedom. Paul does not preach a bypass of death. He preaches deliverance through it.

Calvinism does not teach that a person is made alive in Christ, then dies, then is made alive again. It rightly avoids that sequence. The point of this diagram is to show that, because “dead in sins” is treated as ontological and prior to Christ, baptism and “dying with Christ” cannot function as real death-events without creating incoherence. As a result, they are reclassified as symbolic or declarative rather than participatory.

Pastoral thread (to tie it back one last time)

The danger, pastorally, is subtle:

A person may experience belief and conclude they are “alive,” yet never have passed through Christ’s death in a way that ends self-justification, striving, and works. The old life is not buried; it is simply declared forgiven.

Paul’s gospel is more honest—and more freeing.

It does not ask whether you felt alive before believing.
It asks whether you died with Christ, so that the life you now live is no longer your own.
