# Chapter 40 — “No One Can Come Unless the Father Draws”: John 6:44 Revisited

## The Text Itself

> “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me **draw** him: and I will raise him up at the last day.”  
> *(John 6:44, KJV)*

John 6:44 is one of the most frequently cited texts in determinist and Calvinist arguments for irresistible grace and regeneration preceding faith. It deserves careful, patient handling, because it is often treated as if it settles the entire debate by itself.

This chapter moves slowly and methodically, because the issue is not merely theological. It is linguistic, contextual, and structural.

## How Calvinism Commonly Presents John 6:44

To be fair, we should state the Calvinist reading in its strongest form.

In the standard Reformed account:

1. Humanity is “dead in sin” in the sense of **moral and spiritual inability**.  
2. Therefore, no one can truly come to Christ unless God first acts.  
3. In John 6:44, “draw” is read as **effectual pulling**, not mere invitation.  
4. This “drawing” is identified with **regeneration (new birth)** or the **effectual call**.  
5. The one drawn will certainly come, and the one who comes will certainly be raised.

In other words, John 6:44 becomes proof that the decisive saving action happens *prior* to faith, and it is *irresistible*.

That reading has internal consistency—but only if one key move is made and sustained: **draw must be treated as regeneration, and it must function as causation rather than attraction.**

That is the move we now examine.

## The Greek Verb Behind “Draw”

The verb in John 6:44 is **ἕλκω / ἑλκύω** (*helkō / helkyō*).

Lexically, it is not controversial that the verb can be used in **more than one way**.

Greek lexicons list a forceful sense:

- draw, drag, haul by exertion or force

But they also list a second semantic domain that matters greatly for John’s Gospel:

- draw to oneself  
- attract  
- persuade  
- pull toward (often of desire, influence, or value)

So the question is not, *Can the word ever mean drag?*  
It can.

The question is, **Which sense does the context require in John 6:44?**

Words are not defined by dictionaries alone. They are defined by how they function in sentences.

## The Contextual Signal in John 6:44: Two Actions, Not One

John 6:44 explicitly contains **two distinct movements**:

1. The Father **draws**  
2. The person **comes**

> “No man can **come** … unless the Father … **draw** him …”

This structure matters.

When *ἕλκω* is used in the **coercive sense**—dragging a body, hauling a net, pulling a prisoner—the action is **complete in itself**. The verb alone describes the entire movement. The object is relocated by force, and no further response is implied or required.

In ordinary language (Greek included), when a verb of influence or movement is followed by a **second verb of response**, the first verb cannot be functioning as completed force.

Instead:

- the first verb describes an **initiating action**, and  
- the second verb describes the **response** that follows.

Force completes an action.  
Attraction invites continuation.

If someone is dragged, they do not subsequently *come*.  
If someone is attracted, they may.

This is a basic linguistic distinction, not a theological one.

### Why John 6:44 Fits the Two-Verb Pattern

John 6:44 does not describe a single completed action. It describes a **sequence**:

- the Father **draws**  
- the person **comes**

Crucially, the text does not say the person *will* come, but that the person **can** come. The language is explicitly one of **possibility**, not inevitability.

The verb *can* indicates capacity, not compulsion or certainty. It signals that drawing makes coming **possible**, not unavoidable. This fits naturally with drawing understood as attraction or summons, and it resists reading drawing as a force that overrides response.

The verb *come* only makes sense if drawing does **not** already accomplish arrival. Drawing here functions as an initiating movement that **invites approach**, not as a force that replaces approach.

If the person has already been brought near by irresistible force, the capacity to “come” becomes redundant. John’s sentence structure deliberately avoids that redundancy and instead preserves the grammar of invitation and response.

## The LXX Confirms This Usage: Song of Songs 1:4

The Greek Old Testament provides a clear parallel:

> “Draw me; **we will run after you**.”  
> *(Song of Songs 1:4, LXX)*

Here again, the structure is the same:

- drawing initiates  
- response follows

No coercion is present. The drawing awakens desire, and the response is voluntary pursuit.

John 6:44 follows this same linguistic pattern. Drawing is the summons that precedes coming, not the force that replaces it.

This matters because John’s Gospel frequently operates in **relational and covenantal categories**, love and hate, light and darkness. The LXX already supplied a well-established register in which *ἕλκω* functions as **attraction that invites response**.

---

## To Be Fair: Coercive Uses Exist

The New Testament itself uses *ἕλκω* in plainly forceful contexts—dragging people before authorities, hauling nets, pulling with physical exertion.

So the issue is not whether Calvinists can point to coercive examples. They can.

The issue is whether John 6:44 belongs to that category.

The presence of a second verb of response (*come*) strongly indicates that it does not.

---

## Extra-Biblical Greek Usage: Both Senses Are Real

Greek literature outside Scripture confirms the same pattern.

### Forceful Usage

In classical literature (e.g., Homer), *ἕλκω* is used for dragging bodies or hauling objects. The action is complete in itself. No response is implied or expected.

### Attraction Usage

In philosophical and moral contexts, *ἕλκω* is used for:

- the soul being drawn toward the good  
- desire pulling the will  
- persuasion rather than compulsion  

Across these sources, one pattern holds:

> When *ἕλκω* means force, the action is complete.  
> When it means attraction, it is followed by a response verb.

John 6:44 belongs to the second category.

---

## The System Move: Redefining “Draw” as Regeneration

At this point, determinist theology makes a necessary move.

Because John 6:44 contains both:
- divine initiative (the Father draws), and
- human response (the person comes),

the system collapses the two into one.

The functional redefinition becomes:

> **draw = regenerate (new birth)**

So the verse is effectively read as:

> “No one can come unless the Father first makes him alive so that he must come.”

But this is not what the text says; however, it is what the determistic system requires.

---

## Why “Come” Becomes Strange Under This Reading

If drawing already places the person **in Christ** through regeneration, then the notion of subsequently *coming* to Christ becomes conceptually awkward.

The verse begins to describe someone who is made alive *in relation to Christ* in order to then approach Christ.

That is not how the sentence reads.

John keeps both verbs because they describe **different actions**:
- drawing enables approach
- coming completes approach

---

## John 12:32 — Not a Countertext, but a Clarifier

Many debates rush immediately to John 12:32, but the deeper issue is not the word *all*. It is the meaning of *draw*.

> “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will **draw all** men unto me.”  
> *(John 12:32, KJV)*

This is the same verb, used by the same author, in the same Gospel.

If *draw* means irresistible regeneration in John 6, then John 12 implies universal regeneration or universal salvation.

To avoid this, determinist readings quietly split the verb:
- effectual in John 6  
- general in John 12

But John himself locates the drawing in the public, revelatory event of Christ being “lifted up.” This aligns naturally with attraction, not secret regeneration.

John 12 does not contradict John 6. It **defines the mode of drawing**.

---

## Why This Matters for Dying With Christ

Chapter 33 established that Paul speaks of death as **dominion**, not ontological non-being, and that freedom from sin comes through **dying with Christ**.

If John 6:44 is read as regeneration first (life first), the gospel sequence is reversed:

- life is granted before death-with-Christ  
- dying-with-Christ is reclassified as symbolic or sanctification language  

But Paul says:

> “He that is dead is freed from sin.”  
> *(Romans 6:7)*

If a person is already ontologically dead before Christ, then—by Paul’s logic, they should already be free from sin. Yet Paul insists that freedom comes through **participation in Christ’s death**.

The regeneration-first reading forces this contradiction and then resolves it by quietly diminishing baptismal death and participatory union.

---

## Conclusion: John 6:44 Does Not Teach the Bypass of Death

John 6:44 only becomes a determinist proof text if:

- drawing is equated with regeneration,  
- coming is treated as guaranteed and redundant,  
- John 12 is redefined to preserve the system, and  
- Paul’s death-with-Christ is reduced to metaphor.

If the Johannine grammar is allowed to stand, the verse reads naturally:

- The Father draws through revelation and attraction.  
- Drawing enables coming.  
- Coming is real response, not self-rescue.  
- Those who come are raised because they enter Christ.

And if the apostolic grammar is allowed to stand, the gospel remains coherent:

- Humanity lives under death’s dominion.  
- God draws us to Christ.  
- We come, not as liberators, but as those receiving rescue.  
- We die with Christ, and having died, we are freed from sin.  
- We rise with Christ into newness of life.

Any reading of John 6:44 that grants life prior to death-with-Christ does not merely rearrange a verse. It rearranges the gospel—and turns Paul’s language of dying with Christ into nonsense.

The Father’s drawing is real and powerful.  
But it is not the bypass of death.  
It is the summons into Christ, where death is entered and defeated through participation, not avoided through a hidden mechanism.
