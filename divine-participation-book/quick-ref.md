# From Death to Life  
## The Gospel as Passage

---

## 1. Life — We Were Made for God

> “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” — John 1:4  
> “Let us make man in our image.” — Genesis 1:26  

The story of Scripture begins with **life**.

Humanity was created in the image of God and made for communion with Him. Life was not merely breathing. Life was participation in God's presence. Adam and Eve walked with Him. The Tree of Life stood as a sign of ongoing fellowship.

To live was to share in God's life.

## 2. The Fall — Separation from the Source of Life

> “In the day you eat of it, dying you shall die.” — Genesis 2:17  
> “Your iniquities have separated you from your God.” — Isaiah 59:2  

When Adam sinned, he did not instantly collapse. He entered a state of dying.

Humanity was exiled from the garden. Access to the Tree of Life was cut off. Mortality began.

Death in Scripture is separation from the source of life.

Sin brought separation.  
Separation brought death.  
Death began to reign.

## 3. Death — A Dominion That Enslaves

> “Death reigned…” — Romans 5:14  
> “Through fear of death they were subject to lifelong slavery.” — Hebrews 2:15  
> “You were dead in trespasses and sins.” — Ephesians 2:1  

Death is described as a ruler.

It reigns.  
It enslaves.  
It produces fear.

People are biologically alive, yet living under the dominion of death.

Humanity is not merely guilty.  
Humanity is living in death.

If death is the tyrant, salvation must be deliverance from its rule.

## 4. Passover and the Red Sea — Salvation Through Passage

> “The LORD will pass over the door.” — Exodus 12:23  
> “All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.” — 1 Corinthians 10:2  

Israel was not in a courtroom. They were in bondage.

The lamb marked them.  
The sea separated them.  
Egypt's dominion was broken.

They passed from slavery into covenant life.

The Exodus becomes the pattern:

- Bondage  
- Passage through death  
- New life under a new Lord  

---

## 5. Jesus — Entering Death to Destroy It

> “Through death He destroyed the one who has the power of death.” — Hebrews 2:14  
> “The last enemy to be destroyed is death.” — 1 Corinthians 15:26  
> “God raised Him up.” — Acts 2:24  

Jesus entered our condition fully.

He took on flesh.  
He shared in mortality.  
He entered death.

But death could not hold Him.

Through death He broke death’s dominion.  
Through resurrection He opened the way into new creation.

The cross confronts death.  
The resurrection begins new life.

## 6. Faith, Baptism, and New Life — The Transfer of Dominion

> “As many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death.” — Romans 6:3  
> “We were buried with Him… that we should walk in newness of life.” — Romans 6:4  
> “He who has died is freed from sin.” — Romans 6:7 (KJV)  
> “He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness.” — Colossians 1:13  

Romans 6 speaks the language of dominion and release.

A slave who dies is freed from his master.

In baptism:

- The old man is crucified  
- We are buried with Christ  
- Death’s dominion is broken  

Rising from the water:

- We walk in newness of life  
- We live under a new King  

Salvation is a transfer of dominion.

# Invitation

When the Ethiopian heard the good news about Jesus, he did not ask for a theory.

> “See, here is water. What prevents me from being baptized?” — Acts 8:36  

He understood the pattern.

Christ died.  
Christ rose.  
Entrance into Christ meant participation.

The gospel is not merely something to agree with.  
It is something to enter.

Believe in Jesus Christ.  
Trust that He has destroyed death.  
Turn from the old dominion.

And like the Ethiopian, ask:

**“What prevents me from being baptized?”**

Pass through the waters.  
Die with Christ.  
Rise into new life.

Death no longer has dominion.  
Life is offered.
