# From Death to Life  
## The Gospel as Passage

---

## 1. Life — We Were Made for God

> “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.” — John 1:4  
> “Let us make man in our image.” — Genesis 1:26  

The story of Scripture begins with **life**.

Humanity was created in the image of God and made for communion with Him. Life was not merely breathing. Life was participation in God's presence. Adam and Eve walked with Him. The Tree of Life stood as a sign of ongoing fellowship.

To live was to share in God's life.

## 2. The Fall — Separation from the Source of Life

> “In the day you eat of it, dying you shall die.” — Genesis 2:17  
> “Your iniquities have separated you from your God.” — Isaiah 59:2  

When Adam sinned, he did not instantly collapse. He entered a state of dying.

Humanity was exiled from the garden. Access to the Tree of Life was cut off. Mortality began.

> “Lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever…” — Genesis 3:22  

God prevented Adam and Eve from eating of the Tree of Life in their corrupted state.

This was not cruelty.  
It was mercy.

To live forever in corruption would have meant permanent separation with no hope of restoration. Death limited corruption and preserved the possibility of redemption.

Sin brought separation.  
Separation brought death.  
Death began to reign.

## 3. Death — A Dominion That Enslaves

> “Death reigned…” — Romans 5:14  
> “Through fear of death they were subject to lifelong slavery.” — Hebrews 2:15  
> “You were dead in trespasses and sins… according to the prince of the power of the air.” — Ephesians 2:1–2  

Death is described as a ruler.

It reigns.  
It enslaves.  
It produces fear.

Paul says we were “dead” while walking — living under another authority, following the course of this world and the prince of the power of the air.

### The Cry of the Enslaved

> “The children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God.” — Exodus 2:23  

They were not asking for a legal adjustment.  
They were crying out for deliverance.

> “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” — Romans 7:24  

This is the cry of a slave.

Humanity is not merely guilty.  
Humanity is living in death.

If death is the tyrant, salvation must be rescue.

## 4. Christ Enters the Human Condition

> “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” — Isaiah 7:14  
> “Since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise partook of the same.” — Hebrews 2:14  

God heard the cry.

The Son became flesh.

He was born of a woman.  
He entered our mortality.  
He shared in flesh and blood.  

Before He could conquer death,  
He entered the realm where death reigns.

---

## 5. Jesus — Entering Death to Destroy It

> “Through death He destroyed the one who has the power of death.” — Hebrews 2:14  
> “The last enemy to be destroyed is death.” — 1 Corinthians 15:26  
> “God raised Him up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it.” — Acts 2:24  

Jesus entered death itself.

He did not die as a victim.  
He entered death as its conqueror.

The grave could not hold Him.

Through death He broke death’s dominion.  
Through resurrection He opened the way into new creation.

The cross confronts death.  
The resurrection begins new life.

## 6. Faith, Baptism, and New Life — The Transfer of Dominion

> “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.” — Mark 16:16  
> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.” — Acts 2:38  
> “As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” — Galatians 3:27  
> “As many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death.” — Romans 6:3  
> “We were buried with Him by baptism into death… that we should walk in newness of life.” — Romans 6:4  
> “He who has died is freed from sin.” — Romans 6:7 (KJV)  
> “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.” — Colossians 1:13 (KJV)

Romans 6 speaks the language of dominion and release.

A slave who dies is freed from his master.

In baptism:

- The old man is crucified  
- We are buried with Christ  
- Death’s dominion is broken  

Rising from the water:

- We walk in newness of life  
- We live under a new King  
- We belong to a new kingdom  

Salvation is a transfer of dominion.

# Invitation

When the Ethiopian heard the good news about Jesus, he did not ask for a theory.

> “See, here is water. What prevents me from being baptized?” — Acts 8:36  

Philip answered:

> “If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.”  
> And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” — Acts 8:37  

When Paul encountered the risen Christ, he was told:

> “Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” — Acts 22:16  

Christ entered our condition.  
Christ entered death.  
Christ rose in victory.

Entrance into Christ means participation.

Believe in Jesus Christ.  
Confess that He is the Son of God.  
Trust that He has destroyed death.  
Turn from the old dominion.

And like the Ethiopian, ask:

**“What prevents me from being baptized?”**



Arise.  
Be baptized.  
Wash away your sins.  
Call on the name of the Lord.

Death no longer has dominion.  
Life is offered.
