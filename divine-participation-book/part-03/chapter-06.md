# Chapter 6 — What Sacrifices Were (and Were Not)

## Introduction

Before we can understand what Christ accomplished, we must first understand what the Old Testament sacrifices actually were—and what they were not. This foundational question shapes everything that follows. If we misunderstand the nature of the sacrificial system, we will inevitably misunderstand the work of Christ.

The dominant modern view—that Old Testament sacrifices functioned as penal substitutes, with animals taking the punishment sinners deserved—finds little support in either the biblical text itself or in how the earliest Christian writers understood these practices. Instead, the evidence points to a very different understanding: sacrifices were primarily about purification, covenant maintenance, and restoration of relationship—not legal substitution.

## What Sacrifices Were: Purification and Cleansing

The primary function of Old Testament sacrifices was **purification and cleansing**, not penal substitution. This is evident from the Hebrew concept of *kippur* (atonement), which fundamentally means "to cover" or "to cleanse"—specifically, to remove ritual impurity and restore the worshiper to a state of cleanness.

### The Blood as Cleansing Agent

Leviticus 17:11 states: "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul." The emphasis here is not on the blood as a substitute receiving punishment, but as a **cleansing agent** that purifies the sanctuary and the worshiper from the pollution of sin.

The Day of Atonement ritual (Leviticus 16) makes this clear: the blood is applied to cleanse the Holy Place from Israel's uncleanness. The sanctuary itself becomes polluted by the sins of the people, and the blood removes that pollution. This is a **purificatory** function, not a penal one.

### Restoration of Relationship

Sacrifices functioned to restore and maintain the covenant relationship between Israel and God. Many offerings—particularly peace offerings and fellowship offerings—were essentially **covenant meals** shared with God. Eating the sacrifice together renewed fellowship and communion. The point was not that God was angry and needed appeasement, but that the relationship had been damaged and needed restoration.

### Pedagogical and Typological Functions

The Ante-Nicene Fathers consistently understood sacrifices as **teaching tools** and **shadows** pointing forward to Christ. Justin Martyr wrote that God "did not Himself need sacrifices, but commanded them for the sake of those who were to be educated" (*Dialogue with Trypho* 18–20). Irenaeus similarly stated that "God did not institute sacrifices because He was in need of them, but that He might instruct the people" (*Against Heresies* 4.17).

These early Christian writers saw every sacrifice as symbolic, foreshadowing a reality fulfilled in Christ:
- The Passover lamb pointed to Christ's self-offering
- The scapegoat represented Christ bearing away sins
- The daily offerings prefigured Christ's continual intercession

But critically, the Fathers never said the animals "took the punishment" instead of humans. The imagery was **representational and typological**, not penal.

## What Sacrifices Were Not: Penal Substitution

The idea that Old Testament sacrifices functioned as **penal substitutes**—where the animal dies instead of the sinner as a legal replacement—is largely absent from both the biblical text and early Christian interpretation. This understanding emerged much later, primarily in post-Anselm medieval theology and was further developed in the Reformation.

### No Evidence of Penal Substitution in the Text

The Old Testament never describes sacrifices in terms of:
- The animal taking the punishment the person deserved
- God requiring blood as a legal payment for sin
- A transfer of guilt from sinner to animal
- The animal suffering the penalty in place of the human

Instead, the language consistently emphasizes **cleansing, purification, and restoration**. The blood removes impurity; it doesn't transfer punishment.

### The Ante-Nicene Consensus

Early Christian writers before Nicaea did not interpret Old Testament sacrifices as "substitutionary penal atonement" in the later Protestant sense. Their views were diverse but consistently emphasized:

- **Symbolic** function: sacrifices were signs pointing to Christ
- **Pedagogical** function: they taught Israel about sin, holiness, and God's mercy
- **Purificatory** function: they cleansed and restored relationship
- **Typological** function: they anticipated the true sacrifice of Christ

The LORD speaking through Isaiah states: "I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats" (Isaiah 1:11). This statement is often misunderstood. The point is not that the sacrifices themselves were wrong or meaningless, but that **God was not pleased with the blood**—which meant the people were sinning and needed cleansing. Through the prophet, God was saying, "I am not pleased with this situation." The sacrifices were necessary because of sin, but God took no pleasure in the blood required by that sin. This underscores that sacrifices were a response to human failure, not something God desired in and of themselves. The Ante-Nicene Fathers, following Isaiah's lead, understood the whole cult as pedagogical—sacrifices pointed to Christ and to spiritual obedience, serving as a necessary but temporary means of dealing with the reality of sin and impurity.

Origen wrote that "the things offered were figures and types, not realities; and He therefore received the things expressed by them in the spiritual fulfillment" (*Homilies on Leviticus*). This typological reading sees sacrifices as signs intended to heal souls and turn them toward the true spiritual reality in Christ—not as legal transactions.

### The Jewish Understanding

Second Temple Jewish thought (the context in which the New Testament was written) also did not view sacrifices primarily as penal substitution. Jewish sources emphasize:

- **Purification**: sacrifices removed ritual impurity and cleansed the sanctuary
- **Covenant maintenance**: they restored fellowship and relationship
- **Repentance**: they symbolized turning back to God
- **Healing**: atonement was understood as healing, not punishment

The rabbinic tradition speaks of sacrifice's role in cleansing and bringing Israel back to fellowship. The emphasis is on **repairing relationship and purifying**, not on satisfying wrath through substitution.

## The Therapeutic and Covenantal Framework

The early church understood sacrifices within a **therapeutic and covenantal** framework rather than a legal-penal one. This aligns with how the Epistle to the Hebrews describes the sacrificial system.

### Hebrews' View of Sacrifices

Hebrews explicitly calls the sacrifices a "shadow" of good things to come (10:1). The repetitive animal sacrifices cannot perfect the conscience; Christ's single offering accomplishes what the rituals could only foreshadow. The temple offerings are pictured as continual but insufficient—they point forward to the one decisive act of Christ.

The Fathers used Hebrews to argue that Old Testament sacrifices were preparatory types. They did not read Hebrews as teaching a legal transaction in which God's wrath is "satisfied" by penal punishment applied to a substitute. Rather, Hebrews emphasizes **cleansing, covenantal fulfillment, and the superior efficacy of Christ's one self-offering**.

### Christ as the True Sacrifice

The universal patristic conviction was that **Christ is the true sacrifice**; the Old Testament sacrifices never did the real work. They were temporary shadows. Only Christ actually reconciles. As Melito of Sardis wrote: "The lamb was slain; Christ is the real Lamb" (*On Pascha*).

This does not mean the Old Testament sacrifices were meaningless. They served crucial functions: teaching Israel about sin and holiness, maintaining covenant relationship, purifying from impurity, and pointing forward to Christ. But they were not **penal substitutes** taking punishment in place of sinners.

## Implications for Understanding Christ's Work

If Old Testament sacrifices were not about penal substitution, then we must reconsider how we understand Christ's sacrifice. The early church saw Christ's work through the lens of **participation**—the key concept from which everything else flows.

**Participation** is the foundational reality: Christ entered into our condition, our humanity, our bondage, our death—not as a substitute standing in our place, but as one who participates with us to transform us from within. From this participation, all other aspects of Christ's work emerge:

- **Through participation**, Christ gained victory over sin, death, and the devil (Christus Victor). By entering into death and conquering it from within, he defeated the powers that held humanity captive.

- **Through participation**, Christ healed and purified humanity. By taking on our flesh, our condition, our brokenness, he restored us to wholeness from the inside out.

- **Through participation**, Christ liberated humanity from bondage. By entering into our slavery to sin and death, he broke the chains from within.

- **Through participation**, Christ recapitulated human life as the new Adam. By living the human life rightly—from birth through death to resurrection—he restored what Adam lost.

This is fundamentally different from seeing Christ's death as a legal transaction where he receives the punishment we deserved. The imagery is **transformative and relational**, not juridical. Christ doesn't stand apart from us, taking our place. He stands with us, participating in our condition, to transform it from within.

And because Christ's work is fundamentally participatory rather than substitutionary, he calls each person to **participate in his death and newness of life**. We are not merely declared righteous from a distance. We are invited into the very death and resurrection of Christ—to die with him and rise with him, participating in the transformation he accomplished. This participation, as we will explore in later chapters, is the means by which we experience the victory, healing, liberation, and restoration that Christ achieved.

## Conclusion

The Old Testament sacrificial system was about **purification, covenant maintenance, and restoration of relationship**—not penal substitution. The blood cleansed; it didn't transfer punishment. The sacrifices taught, pointed forward, and maintained fellowship—they didn't satisfy wrath through legal substitution.

This understanding, shared by both Second Temple Judaism and the Ante-Nicene Fathers, provides the proper foundation for understanding what Christ accomplished. If we begin with a misunderstanding of the Old Testament system, we will inevitably misunderstand the New Testament fulfillment.

The sacrifices were shadows. Christ is the reality. But to understand the reality, we must first understand what the shadows actually were.
