# Chapter 6 — What the Sacrifices Were: Their Purpose, Shape, and Meaning

## The Offerings as Identified in Leviticus

The book of Leviticus describes Israel’s worship and relationship with God with the levitical priesthood as the mediators.  These activities include distinct offerings, rites, and appointed times, each with its own purpose and effect. The following table lists the scripture reference, the offering or rite, description, the purpose, and the result.

| Leviticus Reference | Offering / Rite | Description | Reason / Purpose | Result |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Leviticus 1 | Burnt Offering (*ʿōlāh*) | Entire animal consumed on the altar | Expression of total devotion and surrender to God | Worshiper wholly given to God |
| Leviticus 2 | Grain Offering (*minḥâ*) | Flour, oil, and frankincense; no blood | Acknowledgment of God as provider | Gratitude and dependence expressed |
| Leviticus 3 | Peace / Fellowship Offering (*šĕlāmîm*) | Shared meal between God, priests, and worshiper | Celebration of covenant fellowship | Communion with God enjoyed |
| Leviticus 4 | Sin Offering (*ḥaṭṭāʾt*) | Blood applied to altar or sanctuary | Removal of impurity caused by sin or contamination | Cleansing of sanctuary and people |

## Grouping the Offerings by Their Function

When the offerings and rites of Leviticus are viewed together, they naturally cluster around three primary functions. These groupings reflect how Israel lived in relationship with God: sharing life with him, being cleansed to remain in his presence, and expressing devotion and dependence.

Some offerings appear in more than one grouping, reflecting the integrated nature of covenant life.

---

### Communion with God

These rites center on **shared life before the LORD**, often involving eating, rejoicing, and remembrance. They assume that life with God is possible and focus on sustaining fellowship rather than repairing rupture.

**Offerings and rites in this group include:**
- Peace / Fellowship Offering (*šĕlāmîm*) — Leviticus 3  
- Passover (*pesaḥ*, as appointed time) — Leviticus 23:4–8  
- Portions of the Ordination Offerings — Leviticus 8–9  
- Sukkot (Feast of Booths) — Leviticus 23:33–43  

These rites emphasize belonging, identity, and joyful participation in God’s presence.

---

### Purification and Cleansing from Impurity

This group addresses situations where impurity—whether caused by sin, bodily conditions, or contact with death—threatens God’s dwelling among the people. The focus is on cleansing and restoration rather than punishment.

**Offerings and rites in this group include:**
- Sin Offering (*ḥaṭṭāʾt*) — Leviticus 4  
- Guilt Offering (*ʾāšām*) — Leviticus 5–6  
- Yom Kippur (*yôm hakkippurîm*) — Leviticus 16  
- Cleansing of Skin Disease — Leviticus 14  
- Purification after Childbirth — Leviticus 12  
- Bodily Discharge Offerings — Leviticus 15  

These rites show that “sin” in Leviticus often functions as a source of **defilement** rather than solely as legal guilt. Many conditions requiring purification involve no moral failure at all.

---

### Devotion, Thanksgiving, and Dependence

These offerings express surrender, gratitude, and reliance on God as the giver of life. They are oriented toward worship and acknowledgment rather than cleansing or repair.

**Offerings and rites in this group include:**
- Burnt Offering (*ʿōlāh*) — Leviticus 1  
- Grain Offering (*minḥâ*) — Leviticus 2  
- Pentecost (Feast of Weeks) — Leviticus 23:15–21  
- Portions of the Ordination Offerings — Leviticus 8–9  

These rites embed worship within daily life, harvest, time, and provision, emphasizing that covenant faithfulness is lived out through trust and gratitude.

---

### A Unifying Pattern

Together, these three groupings show that the sacrificial system is not driven by a single concern about sin. Instead, it is oriented toward **maintaining life with God**—through communion, purification, and devotion. Cleansing exists to preserve presence, and devotion flows from restored fellowship.

This framework will be essential as we move forward to consider how these realities find their fulfillment in Christ.

## Purpose of the Blood

In Leviticus 17 we see the purpose of the blood, Leviticus 17:11:

> “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your lives; for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.”

In Leviticus 16 we see the explanation of **atonement**, Leviticus 16:30

> "For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD."

God has given **blood** as a gift for the purpose of **cleansing** from contamination in order to restore fellowship with God. Notice that the cleansing described in Leviticus 16 includes not only people, but also objects and sacred space., Leviticus 16:33

> "And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation."

- for the holy sanctuary
- for the tabernacle of the congregation
- for the altar
- for the priests
- for all the people

When Leviticus 17 says that blood is given “to make atonement,” Leviticus 16 tells us what that atonement actually accomplishes. Blood is effective because it carries life, and that life is applied to **purify what has been contaminated**.


The problem atonement addresses is **uncleanness that accumulates in sacred space**. The result of atonement is **cleansing**, allowing God to continue dwelling among the people.

This chapter in Leviticus leaves no ambiguity: atonement functions to **cleanse** defilement, not to redirect punishment.

The logic flows in this order:

1. Impurity prevents fellowship with God and his presence with the people  
2. God provides life (in the blood) as a means of cleansing
3. Atonement removes defilement so communion may continue 

This understanding did not disappear in later Jewish or early Christian reflection. Jewish tradition continued to speak of Yom Kippur as a means of cleansing and restoration, not punishment. Early Christian writers likewise understood sacrificial blood as purifying rather than penal.

Origen, commenting on Leviticus, described the sacrificial rites as medicinal and instructional, given for the purification of the soul rather than for the satisfaction of divine wrath.

The New Testament reflects this same logic. Hebrews speaks of the blood of sacrifices as effecting “the cleansing of the flesh” (Heb. 9:13), and John writes that the blood of Christ “cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). In each case, blood functions as a means of purification, not as the redirection of punishment.


## The purification rites

This connection between Leviticus 17 and Leviticus 16 is crucial for understanding the impurity offerings as a whole. The sin offering, guilt offering, and Yom Kippur rites all operate within this same framework:

- Life is given to cleanse  
- Blood is applied to sacred space  
- The goal is restoration

Before we ask how these rites find their fulfillment in Christ, we must first recognize what they were actually designed to do. Leviticus defines atonement not by punishment, but by **purification that makes continued life with God possible**.










## Introduction: Letting the System Speak for Itself

Before asking how Christ fulfilled the sacrifices, we must first allow the Old Testament sacrificial system to be understood on its own terms. Too often the sacrifices are explained by importing later theological conclusions into the text rather than by observing how the system actually functioned.

This chapter will not compare Old Testament sacrifices to later theories of atonement. Instead, it will **describe the offerings according to their categories and purposes**, allowing their internal logic to emerge. Only after this groundwork is laid can Christ’s work be understood clearly and faithfully.

## The Sacrificial System as a Whole

The sacrificial system was not a single mechanism with a single meaning. It was a **network of offerings**, each serving a distinct function within Israel’s covenant life. Together, they maintained **cleanness, communion, and continuity of divine presence**.

When viewed as a whole, the offerings consistently engage three fundamental realities of life with God:

1. **Impurity and uncleanness**  
2. **Broken or strained covenant fellowship**  
3. **Dependence upon God for life, provision, and forgiveness**

They did not function as executions carried out on substitutes, but as **ritual actions that restored order, purity, and relationship** within God’s dwelling among his people.

---

## Category One: Purification (Sin and Guilt Offerings)

### Purpose: Cleansing, Not Punishment

The **sin offering** (*ḥaṭṭāʾt*) and **guilt offering** (*ʾāšām*) dealt with **ritual impurity**, not courtroom guilt. These offerings were required not only for moral failure, but also for childbirth, skin disease, bodily discharges, accidental contamination, and contact with death.

This alone reveals what the system is addressing: **defilement**, not legal culpability.

### Where the Blood Is Applied

In purification offerings, the blood is applied not to the sinner, but to the altar, the sanctuary, and—on the Day of Atonement—the Most Holy Place. The issue is that **impurity pollutes God’s dwelling**, threatening continued divine presence.

The blood functions as a **cleansing agent**, removing contamination so that God may continue to dwell among Israel.

---

## Category Two: Ascension (Burnt Offerings)

### Purpose: Total Dedication

The **burnt offering** (*ʿōlāh*) is wholly consumed on the altar. Nothing is eaten, nothing is retained. It symbolizes complete surrender and ascending devotion.

This offering expresses **belonging**, not appeasement. It declares that the worshiper—and by extension Israel—exists for God.

---

## Category Three: Communion (Peace / Fellowship Offerings)

### Purpose: Shared Life with God

The **peace offering** (*šĕlāmîm*) culminates in a shared meal between God, priest, and worshiper. These offerings celebrate thanksgiving, fulfilled vows, and voluntary devotion.

God is not being persuaded to forgive. **Communion already exists and is being reaffirmed.**

---

## Category Four: Provision and Dependence (Grain and Drink Offerings)

### Purpose: Acknowledging God as Sustainer

Grain offerings involve agricultural produce rather than blood. They express gratitude, dependence, and recognition that life itself is sustained by God.

Again, there is **no penal logic here**—only trust and thanksgiving.

---

## Category Five: Removal of Impurity (The Scapegoat)

### Purpose: Bearing Away, Not Being Punished

On the Day of Atonement, one goat is sacrificed, and the other is sent into the wilderness. The scapegoat is not killed, not punished, and not offered on the altar. It dramatizes **the removal of impurity**, not the execution of judgment.

---

## The Sacrificial System as Pedagogy

The sacrifices taught Israel physically and repeatedly that sin contaminates, God is holy, cleansing is necessary for communion, and life with God requires ongoing restoration.

The Ante-Nicene Fathers consistently interpreted the sacrificial system as **instructional and preparatory**, not juridical—figures and shadows training humanity for participation in divine life.

---

## What the Sacrifices Did Not Do

The sacrifices are never described as legal penalties transferred to animals, executions in place of sinners, or satisfaction of wrath through death. These ideas are **absent from the structure of the system itself**.

The prophets’ critiques expose the provisional nature of sacrifices, not their meaning. God took no pleasure in the condition that made them necessary.

---

## Preparing the Way for Christ

The sacrifices did real work—but not final work. They maintained cleanness, preserved divine presence, sustained covenant life, and taught Israel through embodied practice. But they could not heal the human condition, end corruption, defeat death, or perfect the conscience.

They prepared the way for a **true and living sacrifice** that would transform reality itself.

---

## Conclusion: A System of Cleansing, Not Condemnation

The Old Testament sacrificial system was oriented toward **purification, communion, and covenant continuity**, not penal substitution. Its logic is relational and therapeutic, not legal and punitive.

The shadows cleanse temporarily.  
The reality heals permanently.

Christ does not replace the system by reversing its meaning—  
he fulfills it by **bringing its purpose to completion**.
