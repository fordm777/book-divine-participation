# Chapter 14 — Baptism: Participation in Death and New Life

## Introduction: Participation Is Entered by Faith

Faith is not mere agreement with a set of claims. Faith is trust that yields itself to God. Scripture repeatedly portrays saving faith as obedient reliance, the kind of trust that submits to God’s appointed means without trying to redefine them.

For this reason, participation in Christ is always entered **by faith**. Yet Scripture does not describe participation as an inner experience detached from the body. The gospel announces a passage from one dominion to another, and that passage is described as **death, burial, and resurrection**.

This chapter states plainly where the apostles locate that passage. Baptism is not presented as religious decoration, nor as a competing work, but as **the moment where faith enters Christ’s death and new life**.

## The Pattern Scripture Establishes: Death, Burial, Resurrection

### Romans 6: Baptized Into His Death

Paul writes:

> “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:3–4)

The sequence is not ambiguous.

- Baptism is described as being baptized **into Christ**
- That union is described as being baptized **into His death**
- Burial is named explicitly
- Resurrection is the basis for “newness of life”

Paul continues:

> “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him… For he that is dead is freed from sin.” (Romans 6:6–7)

Participation is not reduced to reflection. It is entry into a death that severs dominion. This is entered **by faith**, not by mental assent alone.

### Colossians 2: Burial and Rising Through Faith

Paul writes:

> “Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.” (Colossians 2:12)

This statement is especially important because Paul names baptism and then names faith in the same breath. Baptism is not treated as a substitute for faith. It is treated as the point where faith yields to God’s action.

Paul’s language is not “faith instead of baptism,” but “raised with Him **through the faith of the operation of God**,” while being “buried with Him in baptism.”

Participation in death and resurrection is entered **by faith**, and baptism is the place where that faith submits to God’s operation.

## Baptism as Covenant Crossing: The Exodus Pattern

Paul describes Israel’s exodus:

> “All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.” (1 Corinthians 10:1–2)

The passage matters because it identifies baptism as a **covenant crossing**. Israel’s transition out of bondage was not described as an invisible inward moment. It was located in a passage through water, under God’s deliverance, into a new identity.

This does not make baptism “mechanical.” It makes baptism covenantal. Covenant transitions in Scripture are enacted through appointed signs, received **by faith**, not by self-generated merit.

## “Baptism Now Saves You” (1 Peter 3)

Peter writes:

> “The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 3:21)

Peter clarifies two things at once.

1. Baptism is connected to salvation: “baptism doth also now save us.”  
2. Baptism is not a mere bath: “not the putting away of the filth of the flesh.”

The saving reality is not the water as an object. The saving reality is the appeal of conscience toward God, grounded in resurrection. In other words, baptism is **faith’s covenantal appeal**, enacted in the appointed sign, anchored in Christ’s resurrection.

## The Apostolic Practice in Acts

Acts does not present baptism as an optional later symbol. It presents baptism as the ordinary apostolic response to faith.

### Acts 2:38 — Baptism and Remission

Peter says:

> “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (Acts 2:38)

Repentance is faith turning. Baptism is faith entering. The text does not treat baptism as a competing work, but as part of the gospel response, received **by faith**.

---

### Acts 22:16 — “Wash Away Thy Sins, Calling on His Name”

Paul recounts Ananias’ words:

> “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” (Acts 22:16)

This verse joins three realities without embarrassment:
- Baptism
- Washing away sins
- Calling on the name of the Lord

Calling on the Lord’s name is not set against baptism. It is joined to it. Baptism is presented as the appointed moment where faith calls upon the Lord and receives cleansing.

### Acts 10 — Cornelius and the Unity of Spirit and Water

When the Holy Spirit falls on Cornelius’ household, Peter responds:

> “Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized…? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.” (Acts 10:47–48)

The Spirit’s gift does not erase baptism. It confirms inclusion in it. Water and Spirit are not presented as rival “modes,” but as united realities within the one entry into Christ.

---

### Acts 19 — The Authority and Purpose of Baptism

Paul meets disciples at Ephesus and asks:

> “Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.” (Acts 19:3)

Paul explains:

> “John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance… that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.” (Acts 19:4)

Then:

> “When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.” (Acts 19:5)

This passage establishes a necessary distinction.

- John’s baptism involved real water, and it prepared for the Messiah.  
- Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus is participation in what the Messiah accomplished: death and resurrection.

The water is not the central issue. The covenantal authority and purpose are.

## Belief and Baptism (Mark 16:16)

Jesus says:

> “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” (Mark 16:16)

The sentence pairs belief and baptism on the positive side, and it names unbelief as the decisive negative. This aligns with the apostolic pattern throughout Acts and the epistles: baptism is not separated from faith, and faith is not described as detached from baptismal entry.

(Where readers bracket the longer ending of Mark, the same pattern is already established in Romans, Acts, and Peter.)

---

## Born of Water and Spirit (John 3:5) in Its Context

Jesus tells Nicodemus:

> “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5)

The sentence speaks of one birth with water and Spirit joined together. John’s Gospel then immediately turns to baptismal activity:

> “After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.” (John 3:22)

John’s narrative does not treat water as incidental. It places “water and Spirit” within a context where baptizing is the visible practice surrounding the proclamation of the kingdom.

New birth is Spirit-wrought, and it is entered **by faith**, yet the text does not detach that entry from the baptismal setting in which John places it.

## Cleansing, Atonement, and the Witness of Water, Blood, and Spirit

### The Two Birds: Blood and Water Together

Leviticus describes cleansing through blood and running water:

> “He shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water… and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water.” (Leviticus 14:50–51)

The cleansing pattern joins life, blood, and water. The logic is not courtroom sentencing, but purification so that communion with God may be restored.

### Water, Blood, Spirit

John writes:

> “This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood… And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.” (1 John 5:6–8)

Water, blood, and Spirit are not competing explanations. They witness together.

### Hebrews: Hearts Sprinkled and Bodies Washed

Hebrews exhorts:

> “Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith… having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.” (Hebrews 10:22)

The passage joins inward cleansing and embodied washing. It also explicitly grounds this approach in “full assurance of faith.” The movement is covenantal, cleansing-centered, and entered **by faith**.

## Conclusion: Baptism as Faith’s Entry Into Death and Life

Scripture describes salvation as passage from bondage to freedom, from old dominion to new life. That passage is consistently named as death, burial, and resurrection.

Baptism is presented as the appointed moment where faith submits to that passage.

Not as magic.  
Not as merit.  
Not as an optional symbol detached from entrance.  

But as covenantal participation **by faith**, where the old man is put to death with Christ, and newness of life begins in Him.

> “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead… even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4)
