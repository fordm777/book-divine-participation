# Chapter 18 — Adoption: From Slaves to Sons

## The Strongest Form of the Objection

Galatians 4:4–7 states:

> "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son…  
> To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons…  
> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."

The objection is typically framed like this:

1. Adoption is a legal act.  
2. Legal acts do not require death or participation.  
3. Therefore salvation is primarily a legal status change.  
4. Baptism and dying with Christ must therefore be symbolic rather than constitutive.

This argument deserves careful engagement. Paul is using real legal language from his world. But modern readers often misunderstand what "adoption" meant in the first century.

## Modern Adoption vs. Roman Adoption

Modern Western Christians often imagine adoption as:

- An unwanted infant.
- No participation by the child.
- A purely administrative reassignment.
- A sentimental rescue narrative.

That is not what Paul is describing.

In the Roman world, adoption was not primarily about unwanted infants. It was about **transfer of household authority and inheritance rights**.

It was a legal movement from one father's authority to another.

## Roman Adoption in Paul's World

Roman adoption (Greek: *huiothesia*; Latin: *adoptio* or *adrogatio*) involved:

- Transfer from one *patria potestas* (father's authority) to another.
- Severance from the former household.
- Cancellation of prior familial obligations.
- Establishment of new inheritance rights.
- A new legal identity within a new family.

The Roman jurist **Gaius** (2nd century AD) describes adoption as a formal procedure by which someone passes into another's paternal authority (*Institutes* 1.97–107).

Later, **Justinian's Institutes** preserves the same legal framework, distinguishing between adoptio and adrogatio. Both forms involve formal transfer into a new paternal authority.

Roman legal discussions of *capitis deminutio minima* describe a change of family status — a genuine shift of legal identity.

In practical terms:

The adopted son was no longer reckoned as belonging to his former household.  
He now belonged entirely to the new father.

Adoption meant transfer.

Not addition.  
Not coexistence.  
Transfer.

## The Structure of Galatians 4

Paul's argument follows a clear sequence:

1. Bondage under guardians.
2. Redemption from that bondage.
3. Adoption as sons.
4. Inheritance as heirs.

> "To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."

Adoption is not the mechanism of redemption.

Adoption is the result of redemption.

Redemption (*exagorazō*) means to buy out of slavery.

The sequence is:

Bondage → Redemption → Adoption → Inheritance.

Adoption presupposes release.

## Early Church Witness (Ante-Nicene)

The Ante-Nicene Fathers do not treat adoption as a bare legal fiction. They consistently connect it to participation and transformation.

### Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202)

In *Against Heresies*, Irenaeus repeatedly references the "Spirit of adoption" (Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6). He connects adoption to:

- Receiving the Spirit.
- Participation in incorruption.
- Restoration of likeness in Christ.

For Irenaeus, sonship flows from union with Christ, the true Son. Adoption is not external paperwork; it is entrance into divine life.

### Tertullian (c. 155–240)

Tertullian cites Galatians 4:6 ("Abba, Father") to show that believers truly belong to God. The Spirit's indwelling is evidence of sonship. Adoption is relational and Spirit-confirmed.

### Origen (c. 185–254)

Origen treats adoption as growth into sonship through participation in Christ. It is dynamic and transformative, not static or purely declarative.

Across the Ante-Nicene period, adoption is consistently associated with:

- Transfer from slavery to sonship.
- Reception of the Spirit.
- Participation in divine life.
- Entrance into inheritance.

It is not treated as a purely forensic declaration.

## Adoption and Baptism in Galatians

Immediately before the adoption language, Paul writes:

> "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." (Gal 3:27)

The structure is deliberate:

- Baptized into Christ.
- Clothed with Christ.
- No longer slave.
- Now son.
- Now heir.

Adoption follows incorporation into Christ.

It does not replace it.

---

## Severance Is Assumed

The key question is:

From what are we adopted?

Paul answers:

> "Them that were under the law."

Adoption assumes exit from prior authority.

In Roman legal imagery, adoption required severance from the old household.

In Paul's theology elsewhere (Romans 7), release from covenantal authority requires death.

The pattern remains consistent:

Transfer requires release.  
Release requires severance.  
Severance, in Paul's theology, is accomplished through participation in Christ's death and resurrection.

Adoption names the new status after that transfer.

---

## Conclusion

Modern readers often import a sentimental infant-adoption model into Galatians 4.

Paul's world knew nothing of that model.

In Roman law, adoption meant:

- Transfer of household authority.
- Severance from former identity.
- Establishment of new inheritance.
- Recognition of a new father.

The Ante-Nicene church read it within a participatory and transformative framework.

Paul structures Galatians 4 around bondage, redemption, and transfer.

Adoption does not bypass the dominion-transfer logic of dying with Christ.

It names the result.

You are no longer under the old master.  
You now belong to a new Father.  
You are no longer a slave.  
You are a son.  
And if a son, then an heir.

Adoption, rightly understood, strengthens the participatory framework.

It does not weaken it.
