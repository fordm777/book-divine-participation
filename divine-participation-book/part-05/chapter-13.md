# Chapter 13 — Faith, Belief, and Works

## Introduction

Few topics generate more confusion and division among Christians than the relationship between faith, belief, and works. One group emphasizes “faith alone” and sees works as evidence. Another emphasizes that “faith without works is dead” and sees works as essential. Still others speak of “obedience” and “discipleship” in ways that seem to contradict “grace alone.”

The problem is not that one side is right and the other wrong. The problem is that **different theological traditions are using the same words to mean different things**. They are talking past each other, not because they disagree fundamentally, but because they are operating with different definitions and frameworks.

Before Scripture can be reconciled, the language itself must be clarified.

## The Biblical Language of Faith

The New Testament uses the Greek word **πίστις** (*pistis*), which carries a range of meanings:
- **Trust** — reliance upon, confidence in  
- **Faithfulness** — loyalty, fidelity, steadfastness  
- **Belief** — intellectual assent  
- **Faith** — the orientation of one’s life toward God  

This richness is not a problem. The confusion arises when one meaning is isolated and treated as the whole.

## Faith as Trust and Reliance

In many contexts, faith means **trust**. That is, entrusting oneself to God rather than merely affirming facts about Him. This is relational and directional. Faith moves *toward* God.

In Scripture, faith is not confined to the mind. It is something lived through the body. **Embodied faith is faith that takes bodily form through movement, obedience, submission, and concrete action rather than remaining internal or abstract.** This embodied faith is not human effort added to belief, but trust enacted in response to God’s word. It is doing what God says while trusting Him to do what He promises.

In the biblical context, faith shows itself in where a person goes, what they obey, what they risk, and whom they trust with their body and future. It is expressed through concrete action rather than abstract thought.

This understanding emphasizes:
- relationship rather than information  
- dependence rather than control  
- confidence in God’s character  

---

## Faith as Faithfulness

In other contexts, *pistis* means **faithfulness**—loyalty and perseverance over time. Faith is not momentary agreement but continued allegiance.

This understanding emphasizes:
- obedience  
- endurance  
- loyalty through suffering  

---

## Faith as Belief

Sometimes faith does refer to belief—assent to what is true. Doctrine matters. Truth matters. But belief alone is never treated as sufficient faith in Scripture.

Belief without trust, allegiance, or obedience is repeatedly shown to be empty.

---

## The Reformed Emphasis: “Faith Alone”

The Reformed tradition emphasizes **faith alone** in order to protect grace from human effort. Within this framework:
- faith is trust in Christ’s completed work  
- justification is a legal declaration  
- works are evidence, not participation  

This framework operates primarily within a **forensic / courtroom imagination**. Salvation is conceived as a verdict rendered by a judge, and faith is confidence that the verdict is true.

While this framework rightly rejects self-salvation, it unintentionally reshapes faith into something largely **cognitive and passive**.

---

## The Problem with “Finished Work” Language

The phrase “finished work of Christ” is not a biblical phrase, nor is it used by the early church. It emerged later to support a legal framework of salvation.

Scripture presents Christ’s saving work as the **whole Christ-event**:
- incarnation  
- death  
- resurrection  
- ascension  
- ongoing intercession  

Atonement is not punishment absorbed; it is **cleansing applied**. Christ’s work is not completed at death alone, but through resurrection and ascension into the heavenly sanctuary, where He applies life.

Without resurrection, Paul says, faith is futile.

---

## The Early Church Emphasis: Faith as Participation

The early church consistently understood faith as **participation in Christ**:
- union with Him  
- sharing in His death and life  
- transformation from within  

Works were not external evidence added later. They were the **natural expression** of participation itself.

This is why James can say that faith without works is dead—not because works save, but because faith that does not participate is not faith at all.

## The Same Word, Two Different Rooms

Much confusion arises because the same words are spoken from different rooms.

### Faith in a Courtroom Framework

In a courtroom framework:
- **Faith** = believing a verdict is true  
- **Trust** = accepting payment has been made  
- **Justification** = legal declaration  
- **Works** = evidence after the verdict  

Faith is primarily mental assent. Obedience must be carefully separated so it does not appear to threaten grace.

### Faith in a Temple–Participation Framework

**Salvation is not presented as a courtroom verdict in the New Testament, but as participation in life.**

Faith therefore functions very differently:
- **Faith** = entrusting oneself  
- **Faith** = transferring allegiance  
- **Faith** = opening the body to indwelling life  
- **Faith** = ongoing participation in Christ  

Faith is relational, embodied, and directional. It answers the question:  
*To whom do I now belong, and in whom do I live?*

Justification here is not detached declaration, but union with the Righteous One and participation in His life. Assurance comes not from paperwork, but from **presence**.

## Faith Seen Clearly: Why the Courtroom Framework Fails

Hebrews 11 repeatedly says **“by faith,”** not “because they had faith.”  
Faith is not treated as a prior mental possession that later produces action. It is the **mode of trust-filled obedience through which God’s action is encountered**.

This becomes unmistakably clear when familiar biblical examples are examined carefully.

### Naaman (2 Kings 5)

#### What faith is *not* here (courtroom assumptions)

Naaman does not:
- believe a doctrine  
- accept a verdict  
- mentally agree that God can heal  
- trust that a decision has already been made on his behalf  

In fact, he initially **rejects** God’s instruction because it offends his expectations.

#### How faith actually functions (participation)

Naaman must physically go to the Jordan and wash his body. Faith is not located in his mind, but enacted through his flesh. The water itself accomplishes nothing. Healing is explicitly God’s work. Faith yields by submitting to God’s means.

Afterward, Naaman renounces other gods and pledges loyalty to the God of Israel. His flesh is restored “like that of a little child.” Life is not declared; it is given.

📌 **Key insight:**  
Naaman is healed *after* embodied obedience, not after correct belief. Faith is trusting God enough to submit to His action, even when His means appear foolish.

---

### Joshua and Jericho (Joshua 6)

Israel does not believe a promise and wait passively. They march, circle, remain silent, and shout. Faith involves the whole body of the people.

God acts only after obedience, by a means that makes no military sense. Israel learns to trust God’s command rather than human strategy.

📌 **Key insight:**  
Faith here is not confidence in a settled verdict. It is acting on God’s word in reliance on God’s promised action.

---

### Peter Walking on Water (Matthew 14)

Peter steps out of the boat without assurance of success. Faith moves his body into danger. He walks because Christ sustains him, not because he possesses certainty.

When trust falters, he sinks. When he cries out, Christ restores him.

📌 **Key insight:**  
Faith is relational and ongoing. It is not belief in an outcome, but trust enacted moment by moment.

---

### The Unifying Pattern (This Matters)

All three accounts follow the same structure:

1. **God initiates with a command or invitation joined to a promise of what He will do.**  
2. **Faith responds bodily to that word.**  
3. **God acts as promised.**  
4. **Life or deliverance is experienced.**  
5. **Allegiance is clarified.**

These accounts do not work if faith is defined as belief in a verdict already issued. They only make sense if faith is **embodied trust that yields to God’s promised action**.

Scripture does not present faith as something one *has* and then acts upon. Scripture presents faith as the **way one acts in trusting reliance on God**.

---

## Paul Makes This Explicit (Colossians 2)

Paul writes that we are raised with Christ **through faith in the operation of God**.

Faith is not the power that raises. God is.  
Faith is the trust that yields to God’s working.

---

## Why This Difference Matters

In a courtroom framework:
- faith is opposed to obedience  
- baptism risks becoming a work  
- warnings sound like threats  
- the body becomes secondary  

In a temple–participation framework:
- faith generates obedience  
- baptism is faith enacted  
- warnings preserve life  
- the body becomes sacred space  

This is why Scripture can speak of faith as something that must be obeyed, continued in, lived by, and worked out.

---

## Conclusion

Scripture presents something richer and riskier than faith as internal agreement.

Biblical faith is not confidence in a verdict already issued, but trust lived out in response to God’s word. It is embodied faith, a faith that moves, obeys, risks, and endures, not to earn life, but because life is promised. Faith is lived where God has spoken, and it places the whole person where God has pledged to act.
