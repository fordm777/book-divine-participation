# Chapter 11 — Faith, Belief, and Works

## Introduction

Few topics generate more confusion and division among Christians than the relationship between faith, belief, and works. One group emphasizes "faith alone" and sees works as evidence. Another emphasizes that "faith without works is dead" and sees works as essential. Still others speak of "obedience" and "discipleship" in ways that seem to contradict "grace alone."

The problem is not that one side is right and the other wrong. The problem is that **different theological traditions are using the same words to mean different things**. They are talking past each other, not because they disagree fundamentally, but because they are operating with different definitions and frameworks.

## The Biblical Language of Faith

The New Testament uses the Greek word **πίστις** (*pistis*), which can mean:
- **Trust**: Reliance on, confidence in
- **Faithfulness**: Loyalty, fidelity, steadfastness
- **Belief**: Intellectual assent to propositions
- **Faith**: The whole orientation of life toward God

This richness of meaning creates both opportunity and confusion. Different traditions emphasize different aspects of this multifaceted concept.

### Faith as Trust and Reliance

In many contexts, faith means **trust**—relying on God, having confidence in his character and promises. This is relational, not merely intellectual. It is about **entrusting oneself** to God, not just believing things about God.

This understanding emphasizes:
- **Relationship over information**: Knowing God, not just knowing about God
- **Dependence**: Relying on God's provision and power
- **Confidence**: Trusting in God's character and promises

### Faith as Faithfulness

In other contexts, *pistis* means **faithfulness**—loyalty, fidelity, steadfastness. This is active, not passive. It involves commitment, perseverance, and obedience.

This understanding emphasizes:
- **Loyalty**: Remaining true to God
- **Perseverance**: Enduring through trials
- **Obedience**: Following God's commands

### Faith as Belief

Sometimes faith means **belief**—intellectual assent to certain propositions. This is cognitive, involving the mind's acceptance of truth claims.

This understanding emphasizes:
- **Doctrine**: Correct beliefs about God
- **Assent**: Agreement with theological propositions
- **Knowledge**: Understanding of truth

## The Reformed Emphasis: "Faith Alone"

The Reformed tradition, building on Luther and Calvin, emphasizes **"faith alone"** (*sola fide*). In this framework:
- **Faith** = Trust/reliance on Christ's finished work
- **Works** = Human effort that cannot save
- **Justification** = Legal declaration based on faith alone
- **Works** = Evidence of genuine faith (but not part of justification)

This framework operates with a **forensic/legal** understanding of salvation. Justification is a legal declaration, and faith is the instrument that receives it. Works are important, but they are **separate from** justification—they are evidence of it, not part of it.

### The "Finished Work" Language

The Reformed emphasis on "the finished work of Christ on the cross" reflects this framework. This phrase has become so common in Western Christianity that many assume it is biblical language. But it is not found in the New Testament or the early church. It emerged in the Reformed tradition, particularly in the context of defending *sola fide* and penal substitutionary atonement, and has since crept into mainstream Western Christianity.

The phrase suggests that salvation is **complete** at the cross—that Christ's work was "finished" when he died. But this creates several problems:

#### The Problem with "Finished Work" Language

First, **atonement does not mean punishment**. As we saw in Chapter 5, the Hebrew concept of *kippur* (atonement) means "to cover" or "to cleanse"—specifically, to remove ritual impurity and restore relationship. Atonement is about **purification and cleansing**, not about satisfying wrath through penal substitution.

If atonement is cleansing rather than punishment, then Christ's work of atonement involves more than just dying on the cross. It involves his **ascension into heaven** and his **ongoing intercession** as high priest, applying his blood to cleanse the heavenly sanctuary and the hearts of believers.

The Epistle to the Hebrews makes this clear. Christ is not merely a sacrifice offered once; he is the **high priest** who "entered once for all into the holy places" (Hebrews 9:12), and who "always lives to make intercession" for us (Hebrews 7:25). His work includes:
- **Death on the cross**: Offering himself as the sacrifice
- **Resurrection**: Victory over death
- **Ascension**: Entering the heavenly sanctuary
- **Ongoing intercession**: Applying the atonement, cleansing and purifying

Jesus did not complete his work until he **ascended and did the atonement work in heaven**. The cross was the offering; the ascension and intercession are the application of that offering.

#### The Biblical Emphasis: The Whole Christ-Event

The biblical emphasis is on the **whole Christ-event**: incarnation, death, **resurrection**, **ascension**, and exaltation. As Romans 4:25 says: "He was delivered for our sins and **raised for our justification**." And Romans 5:10: "We were reconciled by His death... **we shall be saved by His life**."

Paul makes it explicit: "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins" (1 Corinthians 15:17). The cross without the resurrection would be the execution of a failed messiah. The resurrection is essential—not merely as proof that the cross worked, but as the **means by which we are justified and given life**.

The early church emphasized both cross and resurrection together as a single salvific event. Irenaeus spoke of recapitulation—Christ re-living human life in obedience, from birth through death to resurrection. Athanasius stressed that the Word took flesh to destroy death by his death **and resurrection**. Ignatius of Antioch and others constantly tied together cross + resurrection as inseparable.

The "finished work" language, while not entirely wrong, **narrows** the focus in a way that the New Testament and early church did not. It suggests that everything was accomplished at the cross, when in fact the biblical witness shows that Christ's work includes his ongoing ministry in heaven as our high priest, applying the atonement and making intercession.

## The Early Church Emphasis: Faith as Participation

The Ante-Nicene Fathers understood faith differently. For them:
- **Faith** = Participation in Christ, union with him
- **Works** = The natural expression of participation
- **Salvation** = Transformation through participation, not merely legal declaration
- **Faith and works** = Inseparable aspects of participation

This framework operates with a **participatory/transformative** understanding of salvation. Faith is not merely trust that receives a legal declaration. It is **participation** in Christ's death and resurrection, union with him that transforms from within.

### Faith and Works as Inseparable

In this framework, faith and works are not separate. They are **inseparable aspects of participation**. To participate in Christ is to be transformed, and transformation necessarily produces works. But the works are not "added to" faith—they are the **expression of** faith, the natural fruit of participation.

This is why James can say "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26). It is not that works save. It is that **genuine faith** (participation in Christ) **necessarily produces works**. If there are no works, there is no genuine participation.

## Why They Talk Past Each Other

These two frameworks use the same words but mean different things:

**When Reformed says "faith alone":**
- They mean: Trust in Christ's finished work, not human effort
- They emphasize: Legal declaration, not human contribution
- They understand: Faith as instrument that receives

**When others say "faith without works is dead":**
- They mean: Participation in Christ necessarily produces transformation
- They emphasize: Genuine faith is active, not passive
- They understand: Faith as participation that transforms

**Both are right** in their own framework, but they are **talking past each other** because they operate with different definitions and assumptions.

## The Biblical Balance

The New Testament actually contains both emphases, but they are held together:

### Paul's Emphasis on Faith

Paul emphasizes that we are "justified by faith apart from works of the law" (Romans 3:28). This is crucial—salvation is not earned through human effort. It is received through faith.

But Paul's understanding of faith is **rich and participatory**. It is not merely intellectual assent. It is trust, reliance, and **participation in Christ**. "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God" (Galatians 2:20).

### James's Emphasis on Works

James emphasizes that "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26). This is also crucial—genuine faith produces works. It is not merely intellectual assent.

But James is not contradicting Paul. He is emphasizing that **genuine faith** (participation in Christ) **necessarily produces works**. The works are not "added to" faith—they are the expression of faith itself.

### The Integration

The biblical balance is:
- **Salvation is by faith**: Not earned through works
- **Faith is participatory**: Union with Christ, not merely intellectual
- **Participation produces works**: Transformation is inevitable
- **Works are expression of faith**: Not separate from it, but integral to it

## Modern Evangelical Confusion

Modern evangelicalism has often borrowed Reformed language ("finished work," "faith alone") while losing the participatory framework. This creates confusion:

- **"Accept Jesus"** language suggests a one-time decision
- **"Faith alone"** is understood as mere intellectual assent
- **Works** are seen as optional or as "evidence" but not integral
- **Participation** is lost in favor of legal transaction

But the New Testament and early church understood faith as **ongoing participation**, not one-time decision. It is union with Christ that transforms, not merely a legal declaration that acquits.

## The Ante-Nicene Understanding

The early church understood faith as:
- **Trust and reliance**: Confidence in God
- **Participation**: Union with Christ
- **Transformation**: Being changed from within
- **Faithfulness**: Loyalty and obedience

All of these were **integrated**, not separated. Faith was not merely the instrument that receives salvation. It was **participation in salvation itself**—union with Christ that transforms.

## Resolving the Confusion

To resolve the confusion, we need to:

1. **Clarify definitions**: What do we mean by "faith," "works," "justification"?
2. **Recognize frameworks**: Are we operating with legal/forensic or participatory/transformative assumptions?
3. **Hold both emphases**: Salvation is by faith (not earned), and genuine faith produces works (transformation)
4. **Emphasize participation**: Faith is union with Christ, not merely intellectual assent

The biblical answer is not "faith alone" vs. "faith and works." It is **"faith that participates"**—union with Christ that transforms, producing works as the natural expression of that participation.

## Conclusion

Christians talk past each other on faith and works because they are using the same words with different meanings. The Reformed emphasis on "faith alone" (trust in Christ's work, not human effort) is right. The emphasis on "faith without works is dead" (genuine faith produces transformation) is also right.

The resolution is to understand faith as **participation in Christ**—union with him that transforms from within. This faith is not earned (it is gift), but it is not passive (it transforms). It produces works not as "added effort" but as **natural expression** of the participation itself.

When we understand faith as participation, the apparent contradictions resolve. Faith alone saves—but genuine faith (participation) necessarily produces works. Works don't save—but the absence of works reveals the absence of genuine faith (participation).

We are saved by faith, not by works. But the faith that saves is participation in Christ, and participation in Christ necessarily transforms, producing works as its natural fruit.
