# Chapter 17 — Dead Indeed: Reckoning What Really Happened

## The Question That Must Be Asked

Paul writes:

> “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
> (Romans 6:11)

This command is often softened. “Reckon” is treated as though Paul were urging believers to imagine something that is not yet true. As though death were symbolic. As though freedom were psychological.

But Paul does not say, “Pretend you are dead.”

He says, **reckon**.

Reckoning is accounting language. It assumes something has actually occurred.

The question, then, is unavoidable:

**What happened?**

## Death Before Declaration

Romans 6 does not begin with a verdict. It begins with death.

> “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?”
> (Romans 6:3)

Paul does not speak of Christ dying instead of us so that we would not die. He speaks of our participation in His death.

The sequence matters:

* Baptized into Christ
* Baptized into His death
* Buried with Him
* Raised with Him
* Walking in newness of life

Then Paul states:

> “For he that is dead is freed [justified] from sin.”
> (Romans 6:7)

Notice the order.

Not:
Justified → therefore dead.

But:
Dead → therefore justified.

Death severs sin’s claim.

Justification recognizes that severance.

## If Death Is Not Real, Reckoning Becomes Fiction

If Christ died instead of you, and you did not die with Him, then Paul’s language collapses into metaphor.

If you did not actually die to sin:

* Sin’s dominion has not ended.
* The old master still holds jurisdiction.
* “Freed from sin” becomes positional rather than real.

But Paul speaks of dominion ending through death.

He continues:

> “Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.”
> (Romans 6:6)

This is not imagination. It is execution language.

Reckoning, therefore, is not pretending.
It is counting as true what God has accomplished.

## The Consistent New Testament Pattern

Paul is not alone in this language. The New Testament speaks with one voice.

### Death With Christ

* “I am crucified with Christ.” (Galatians 2:20)
* “If we be dead with Christ…” (Romans 6:8)
* “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.” (Colossians 3:3)
* “If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world…” (Colossians 2:20)

### Burial With Him

* “Buried with him by baptism into death.” (Romans 6:4)
* “Buried with him in baptism.” (Colossians 2:12)

### Raised With Him

* “Risen with him through the faith of the operation of God.” (Colossians 2:12)
* “If ye then be risen with Christ…” (Colossians 3:1)
* “Made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.” (Ephesians 2:6)

This is not scattered metaphor. It is a unified grammar.

Death.
Burial.
Resurrection.
Transfer.
