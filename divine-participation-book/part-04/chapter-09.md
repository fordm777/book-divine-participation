# Chapter 9 — New Covenant or Renewed Covenant?

## Introduction

The question matters more than it might first appear. Did Jesus establish a **new covenant**, fundamentally distinct from what came before? Or did he **renew** the existing covenant made at Mount Sinai, essentially restoring and updating what was already there?

The answer shapes how we understand the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, the nature of salvation, and even the work of Christ on the cross and in heaven after his resurrection. If it's a renewed covenant, then continuity is emphasized. If it's a new covenant, then discontinuity and transformation are central.

The biblical evidence, examined carefully in both Hebrew and Greek, points decisively toward a **new covenant**—not a renewal of the old.

## Examining the Hebrew: New vs. Renew

The Hebrew text of Jeremiah 31:31 uses a specific word that makes a crucial distinction.

### The Hebrew Word for "New"

The Hebrew word חָדָשׁ (*châdâsh*, H2319) is used in Jeremiah 31:31 and is consistently translated as "new." This word appears 53 times in the Old Testament, translated 48 times as "new," 4 times as "new thing," and once as "fresh."

Consider how this word is used elsewhere:
- Exodus 1:8: "Now there arose up a **new** [H2319] king over Egypt"
- Deuteronomy 24:5: "When a man hath taken a **new** [H2319] wife"
- Joshua 9:13: "these bottles of wine, which we filled, were **new** [H2319]"
- Isaiah 66:22: "the **new** [H2319] heavens and the **new** [H2319] earth"
- Jeremiah 31:31: "I will make a **new** [H2319] covenant"

In each case, the word denotes something **qualitatively new**, not something renewed or restored. A man doesn't take a "renewed" wife—he takes a new one. A new king isn't a renewed king. The new heavens and earth aren't the old ones renewed.

### The Hebrew Word for "Renew"

The Hebrew word חָדַשׁ (*châdash*, H2318) is the word used for "renew" or "repair." This is a **different word** from the one used in Jeremiah 31:31. The biblical authors had a word for "renew" and chose not to use it when speaking of the covenant.

If God intended to speak of renewing the covenant, the text would use H2318. Instead, it uses H2319—the word for "new." This is a deliberate lexical choice that carries theological significance.

## Examining the Greek: Kainos vs. Renewal Terms

The Septuagint (LXX) translators and the New Testament authors consistently use the Greek word **καινός** (*kainos*, G2536) for "new" in covenant contexts. This word emphasizes something **new in quality or nature**, not merely new in time.

### Kainos in the New Testament

The word *kainos* appears throughout the New Testament in contexts that clearly mean "new" in a qualitative sense:

- Matthew 9:17: "new wine into **new** [G2536] bottles"
- Matthew 27:60: "laid it in his own **new** [G2536] tomb"
- 2 Corinthians 5:17: "a **new** [G2536] creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become **new** [G2536]"
- Hebrews 8:13: "A **new** [G2536] covenant, he hath made the first old"
- Revelation 21:1: "a **new** heaven and a **new** earth"

In each case, translating *kainos* as "renewed" would make no sense. Jesus wasn't buried in a "renewed" tomb. The wineskins weren't "renewed." Old things don't pass away to become "renewed"—they become new.

### Greek Words for Renewal

The New Testament has specific words for "renew" or "renewal" that are **not** used in covenant contexts:

- **ἀνακαινίζω** (*anakainizo*, G339): "to renew" (Hebrews 6:6)
- **ἀνανεόω** (*ananeoo*, G364): "to renew" (Ephesians 4:23)
- **ἀνακαινόω** (*anakainoo*, G340): "to renew" (Colossians 3:10; 2 Corinthians 4:16)
- **ἀνακαίνωσις** (*anakainosis*, G341): "renewing" (Romans 12:2; Titus 3:5)

Notice that all these words have the prefix **ἀνα** (*ana*), which denotes "upward," "back," "again," or "repeatedly"—the idea of restoration or doing something again. The biblical authors had these words available but did not use them when speaking of the covenant.

The distinction is clear: **καινός** (*kainos*) means new in quality; **ἀνα-* words mean renewed or restored. The covenant is described with *kainos*—it is new, not renewed.

## The Context of Jeremiah 31:31-32

The language of Jeremiah 31:31-32 itself indicates a new covenant, not a renewal:

> "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will **make a new covenant** with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: **Not according to the covenant** that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt: which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD."

### "I Will Make" vs. "I Made"

The text contrasts "I **will make**" (future) with "I **made**" (past). God is not saying he will renew or restore the covenant he made with their fathers. He is saying he will **make** a covenant that is **not according to** the previous one.

The phrase "not according to" (Hebrew: *lo k'berit*) explicitly distinguishes this covenant from the previous one. It is different in nature, not a restoration of what was.

### The Marriage Covenant Analogy

The text describes God as having **been** a husband to Israel (past tense). Under the law, a man cannot take back a wife who has been defiled. As we will explore in the next chapter, this creates a legal problem: how can God restore relationship with an unfaithful bride?

The answer is not to renew the old marriage covenant—that would violate the law. Instead, the husband must die, freeing the wife from the old covenant, and then establish a **new covenant** with her. This is precisely what Paul describes in Romans 7:2-3.

## Paul's Testimony: Two Covenants

The apostle Paul explicitly speaks of **two covenants**, not one covenant renewed.

### Galatians 4:24

> "Which things are an allegory: for these are **the two covenants**; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."

Paul identifies **two distinct covenants**:
1. The covenant from Mount Sinai (represented by Hagar), which brings bondage
2. The covenant of promise (represented by Sarah), which brings freedom

These are not the same covenant at different stages. They are **two different covenants** with different natures and different outcomes.

### Romans 7:2-3

> "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."

Paul uses the marriage analogy to explain how Israel is freed from the Sinai covenant. The wife (Israel) is bound to her husband (the covenant) as long as he lives. The only way to free her is for the husband to **die**. Then she is free to enter a new covenant relationship.

This requires the **death** of the old covenant, not its renewal. The old must die so the new can be established.

## The Law of the High Priest

Leviticus 21:14 specifies that the high priest "shall take a virgin of his own people to wife." A widow, divorced woman, profane woman, or harlot cannot be taken by the high priest.

If Jesus Christ is the high priest (as Hebrews clearly teaches), and if Israel has profaned herself among the nations, then the high priest **cannot renew** a covenant with a profaned bride. The law forbids it.

The solution is not to renew the old covenant but to create a **new covenant** that we enter "by dying with him and being raised in newness of life" (Romans 6:4). In this new covenant, we are made new creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17), qualified to be the bride of the high priest.

## Hebrews 8: The First Made Old

The Epistle to the Hebrews makes the distinction explicit:

> "For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers... In that he saith, A **new covenant**, he hath made the **first old**. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away" (Hebrews 8:7-9, 13).

The language is clear:
- The first covenant is made **old**
- It is **decaying** and **vanishing away**
- A **new** covenant is established

You cannot renew something that is old, decaying, and vanishing. You replace it with something new. The old covenant is not restored; it is superseded by the new.

## Theological Implications

Understanding that the covenant is **new** rather than **renewed** has profound implications:

1. **Discontinuity as well as continuity**: There is both continuity (the same God, the same people in one sense) and discontinuity (a fundamentally new arrangement).

2. **The necessity of death**: The old covenant had to die (through Christ's death) for the new to be established. This is not renewal but replacement.

3. **New creation**: Those in Christ are "new creatures" (2 Corinthians 5:17), not renewed old creatures. The transformation is qualitative, not merely restorative.

4. **Freedom from the old**: We are not under the old covenant, renewed. We are under a new covenant, free from the old.

## Conclusion

The evidence from Hebrew and Greek, from the context of Jeremiah, from Paul's teaching, and from the Epistle to the Hebrews all point to the same conclusion: Jesus established a **new covenant**, not a renewed one.

The lexical evidence is clear: different words are used for "new" versus "renew," and the covenant is consistently described with words meaning "new." The contextual evidence is clear: the new covenant is "not according to" the old, the old is made "old" and "vanishes away," and the old must die for the new to be established.

This is not mere semantics. Understanding that the covenant is new—fundamentally different in nature from what came before—shapes how we understand salvation, the work of Christ, and our relationship with God. We are not under a renewed version of the old arrangement. We are participants in something entirely new.
