# Chapter 11 — Covenant Death and Release from Bondage  
*(Why Renewal Is Impossible — Romans 7)*

## Introduction: If the Covenant Were Renewed, Death Would Be Unnecessary

In the previous chapter, we established from Hebrew, Greek, and prophetic context that Scripture speaks of a **new covenant**, not a renewed one. But some still argue that “new” means *newly administered*—that the covenant itself continues, merely repaired, refreshed, or reissued.

Romans 7 answers that claim decisively.

Paul does not merely say the covenant is new. He explains **why it could not possibly be renewed**. His answer is simple and unsettling:

**Covenants do not end through repair. They end through death.**

If renewal were possible, death would be unnecessary. But Paul insists that death is not optional—it is the *only* mechanism of lawful release.

## Paul’s Governing Principle: Authority Lasts Only as Long as Life

Paul opens Romans 7 by appealing to something he assumes is universally understood:

> “The law has dominion over a person as long as he lives.” (Romans 7:1)

This is not moral language. It is **jurisdictional** language.

As long as life remains, authority remains. Obligation persists. Covenant claims stand. There is no category in Scripture for *partial release* from covenant authority while remaining alive.

This alone creates a problem for renewal theology.

If the covenant were merely renewed:
- Authority would remain  
- Jurisdiction would continue  
- Obligation would persist  
- Bondage would not end  

Paul’s entire argument moves in the opposite direction.

## The Marriage Analogy: Death Ends Covenants, Not Forgiveness

To make the point unmistakable, Paul uses marriage:

> “A woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives; but if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband.” (Romans 7:2)

Notice what Paul does *not* say:

- She is released if the husband forgives her  
- She is released if the marriage is repaired  
- She is released if terms are renegotiated  

He says **death releases her**.

Marriage is one of the strongest covenantal bonds in Scripture, and even it is terminated only by death. Forgiveness may heal a relationship, but it does not dissolve covenant authority. Renewal preserves the bond. **Death ends it**.

This is fatal to the renewed-covenant model.

## The Critical Move: *You* Died — the Covenant Did Not Heal

Paul now applies the analogy directly:

> “Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ.” (Romans 7:4)

This sentence alone destroys the idea of covenant renewal.

Paul does not say:
- The law was renewed  
- The covenant was healed  
- The authority structure was softened  

He says **you died**.

The law remains alive. The covenant remains intact in itself. What changes is the **status of the person**. Death ends jurisdiction without changing the law itself.

A renewed covenant would require a living subject.  
A new covenant requires a **dead one raised into a new order**.

## Why Renewal Cannot Produce a New Union

Paul gives the reason for this death:

> “That you may be married to another—to Him who was raised from the dead.”

This is not poetic language. It is legal logic.

As long as the old covenant stands, **no new covenant union is lawful**. Renewal preserves the old bond. Paul insists the bond must end.

This is why Scripture never speaks of:
- Shared covenant heads  
- Overlapping covenant authorities  
- Gradual covenant transitions  

The old covenant must end *before* the new can begin.

Only death accomplishes that.

## The Law Is Not the Problem — Death Is

Paul anticipates the obvious objection:

> “Is the law sin?” (Romans 7:7)

His answer is emphatic: **Certainly not.**

The problem is not the covenant. The problem is **the condition of humanity under death’s dominion**.

When law encounters a humanity enslaved to death:
- Sin exploits the commandment  
- Death weaponizes obedience  
- Bondage intensifies rather than heals  

This confirms what has already been established earlier in this work:  
death is a **reigning power**, not a sentence, and law cannot liberate those still under its rule.

Renewal would leave death untouched. Paul’s solution does not.

## “I Was Alive Once”: Why This Cannot Be Renewal Language

Paul states something that renewal theology cannot absorb:

> “I was alive once without the law…” (Romans 7:9)

This is not the language of total depravity or permanent incapacity. It is the language of **entry into death**, not existence as death itself.

Death is something humanity *enters*, not something humanity *is by essence*. That is why death can be exited—**but only by passing through it**.

Renewal presumes continuity of life. Paul presumes the necessity of death.

---

## The Cry of Romans 7 Is for Deliverance, Not Improvement

Paul’s lament makes the issue explicit:

> “Who will deliver me from this body of death?” (Romans 7:24)

This is not a request for help obeying the same covenant better. It is a plea for **exodus**—release from a dominion.

And dominion does not loosen its grip through renewal. It is broken only by death.

---

## Ante-Nicene Witness: No Covenant Without Death

The early church consistently read Romans 7 this way.

**Irenaeus of Lyons** taught that Christ did not restore Adam’s condition but *recapitulated humanity through death*, bringing the old order to completion so that a new one could emerge beyond it.

**Tertullian** explicitly described baptism as the *legal end of the former life*, insisting that obligations cease only where death has occurred.

**Origen** repeatedly framed salvation as an **exodus from an old regime**, not its repair, emphasizing that law remains authoritative until death lawfully ends its claim.

There is no Ante-Nicene tradition of covenant renewal without covenant death.

## Why Renewal Theology Fails Structurally

A renewed covenant requires:
- The same covenant head  
- The same binding authority  
- The same jurisdiction  
- A living subject under obligation  

Romans 7 allows none of these.

Paul insists:
- The law remains alive  
- The subject must die  
- Authority ends only at death  
- A new union follows resurrection  

Renewal theology tries to cross a boundary Scripture does not recognize.

## Pastoral Consequences: Why Many Remain Bound

Many sincere believers struggle because they are attempting **new-covenant life without covenant death**.

They believe rightly.  
They desire holiness.  
They attempt obedience.

But renewal theology leaves them **alive under an authority they cannot escape**.

Romans 7 explains the bondage. Romans 6 explains the solution. Romans 8 describes the life that follows.

## Conclusion: The Covenant Is New Because the Old Ended

The covenant is not new because God changed His mind.  
It is new because **death occurred**.

The old covenant did not heal.  
It did not improve.  
It did not renew.

It ended.

And only on the far side of death can a truly **new covenant** exist.

Christ did not die to help us live better under the old order.  
He died to bring that order to its lawful end.

Only the dead are free.  
Only the released can belong to another.  
Only those who die with Christ can live in the New Covenant.
