# Chapter 11 — Covenant Death and Release from Bondage  
*(Romans 7)*

## Introduction: Why Renewal Cannot Explain Romans 7

Romans 7 is one of the most debated chapters in the New Testament. Who is the “I” who struggles with sin? Is Paul describing his pre-Christian life, his Christian life, or humanity in general? Why does he say, “I am carnal, sold under sin,” if believers are supposed to be free? And what does the marriage analogy at the beginning of the chapter have to do with the struggle described later?

These questions have generated endless discussion, but they often miss what Paul is actually doing in Romans 7.

Paul is not primarily describing personal spiritual struggle. He is explaining **how covenant death releases from bondage**.

This chapter follows directly from **Chapter 10 — New Covenant or Renewed Covenant?**. There we established that Scripture consistently speaks of a **new covenant**, not a renewed one. Romans 7 now explains *why it could not be otherwise*. If the covenant were merely renewed—repaired, refreshed, or re-administered—Paul’s argument would collapse. Renewal preserves jurisdiction. Paul insists that jurisdiction ends only at death.

**Covenants do not end through repair. They end through death.**

Romans 7 is unintelligible unless covenantal authority truly ceases—not by improvement, but by death.

## The Marriage Analogy: Bound Until Death (Romans 7:1–3)

Paul begins with a legal principle his audience would immediately recognize:

> **Romans 7:1–3** — “The law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth… the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.”

This is not a casual illustration. It establishes the **mechanism of release**.

A woman is bound as long as the husband lives. If she joins herself to another while he lives, she commits adultery. But if death occurs, she is lawfully free.

Paul does not say:
- forgiveness dissolves the bond  
- repentance dissolves the bond  
- covenant renewal dissolves the bond  

He says **death** dissolves the bond.

Marriage is among the strongest covenantal relationships Scripture recognizes, and even it ends only at death. Forgiveness may heal a relationship, but it does not terminate covenant authority. Renewal preserves obligation. **Death ends it**.

## Dominion and Jurisdiction

Paul’s opening claim frames everything that follows:

> “The law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth.”

This is not merely legal language. It is **dominion language**.

Throughout Romans, Paul speaks this way:
- sin has dominion (Romans 6:14)  
- death has dominion (Romans 6:9)  
- the law has dominion (Romans 7:1)  

These are not abstractions. They are **reigning powers**.

Jurisdiction ends only when a person passes out of the realm where that authority operates. Death marks that boundary. A covenant binds the living. The dead are no longer under its claim.

---

## The Critical Question: Who Dies?

At this point, a tension appears. If the woman is bound until the husband dies, and if Israel is bound to the law, does that mean the law must die?

Paul’s answer is unexpected.

---

## “Ye Also Are Become Dead to the Law” (Romans 7:4)

> **Romans 7:4** — “Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead.”

Paul does **not** say the law dies.  
He does **not** say the covenant heals.  
He says **you died**.

This single sentence makes covenant renewal impossible.

The law remains alive, holy, just, and good. What changes is the **status of the person**. Death ends jurisdiction without altering the law itself.

A renewed covenant requires a living subject still under obligation.  
A new covenant requires a **dead subject raised into a new order**.

---

## Death Through the Body of Christ

To become dead to the law occurs “by the body of Christ.”

This refers not only to Christ’s physical death, but to **participation in that death**. Believers are united to Christ in his death. In dying with him, they pass out of the jurisdiction of the law.

This is not legal fiction. It is covenantal reality.

The law has dominion over the living. Those who have died are no longer under its authority. By dying with Christ, believers are lawfully released from the old covenant.

## Married to Another: Why the Covenant Must Be New

The purpose of this death is not freedom from covenant altogether, but entry into a **new covenant union**:

> “That ye should be married to another… to him who is raised from the dead.”

Covenants do not overlap. As long as the first stands, the second cannot lawfully exist. Renewal preserves the old bond. Paul insists the bond must end.

This confirms what we saw in **Chapter 10**: the new covenant is not a repaired Sinai. It is a genuinely new covenant, established only after death has occurred.

The result of this new union is fruitfulness:

> “That we should bring forth fruit unto God.”

Under the old covenant, the fruit was death (Romans 7:5). Under the new, the fruit is life. This is not moral improvement—it is a change of dominion.

---

## Released from the Law (Romans 7:6)

Paul summarizes the transition:

> **Romans 7:6** — “But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.”

Release comes **by death**.

What held us has lost its claim because we have passed out of its jurisdiction. This is not abolition of the law. It is covenant death.

The contrast is between two modes of existence:
- **Oldness of letter** — life under the old covenant, in the flesh  
- **Newness of spirit** — life in the new covenant, in Christ  

There is no gradual transition between these. There is death and resurrection.

## The Law, Sin, and Death (Romans 7:7–13)

Paul anticipates the objection: “Is the law sin?”

His answer is emphatic: **God forbid.**

The problem is not the law. The problem is **sin working through the law** in those still under death’s dominion.

> **Romans 7:12** — “The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”

The law reveals what is right. But when given to people enslaved to sin and death, it cannot produce life. Sin seizes the commandment and uses it as an instrument of death.

The law was ordained to life, but for those under sin’s dominion, it results in death—not because the law is evil, but because **the law cannot give life to the dead**.

---

## “I Am Carnal, Sold Under Sin” (Romans 7:14–25)

The second half of Romans 7 describes a condition of bondage:

> “I am carnal, sold under sin.”

This is not the normal Christian life. It is the condition of those who are still “in the flesh” (Romans 7:5), still under law, still under sin’s dominion.

The person:
- knows what is right  
- wants to do what is right  
- cannot do what is right  

This is not freedom. It is captivity.

The divided will, the repeated failure, the frustration—these are the marks of life **under the law without having died to it**.

---

## The Cry for Deliverance

The section culminates in a cry:

> **Romans 7:24** — “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”

This is not a request for forgiveness. It is a plea for **deliverance**.

The problem is not legal guilt. It is bondage. And bondage cannot be solved by declaration alone. It requires liberation.

---

## The Answer and the Transition to Romans 8

> **Romans 7:25** — “I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

The answer has already been given:
- death with Christ (Romans 6)  
- release from the law (Romans 7)  
- life in the Spirit (Romans 8)  

Romans 8 begins:

> “The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.”

This is liberation, not mere acquittal.

---

## Why Renewal Theology Fails Here

If the covenant were renewed:
- jurisdiction would remain  
- death would be unnecessary  
- Romans 7 would be incoherent  

Paul allows no such category. A covenant binds the living. Death alone releases. Therefore the new covenant cannot be a modification of the old. It exists only because those bound to the old have died and risen in Christ.

---

## Conclusion: Covenant Death Precedes Covenant Life

Romans 7 is not primarily about personal spiritual struggle. It is about **covenant transition**.

The law has dominion over the living. Believers have become dead to the law through the body of Christ. In dying with him, they are lawfully released from the old covenant and free to belong to another.

This is not legal maneuvering. It is covenantal reality.

The struggle of Romans 7 describes life that must be **died out of**. The freedom of Romans 8 describes life that can only exist on the far side of death.

The woman is bound as long as the husband lives. When death occurs, she is free to be married to another.

This is covenant death.  
This is release from bondage.  
This is why the covenant is new.

Death comes before life.  
Burial before resurrection.  
Covenant death before covenant life.
