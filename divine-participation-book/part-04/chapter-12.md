# Chapter 12 — The Jealous Husband

## Introduction: Covenant, Marriage, and Participation

Scripture consistently frames God’s relationship with His people in marital terms. Israel is not merely a subject people, nor merely a contractual partner, but a **bride**. The covenant at Sinai is repeatedly described as a marriage covenant, and God identifies Himself as Israel’s husband.

This marital framing is not poetic ornamentation. It governs how covenant breach, judgment, restoration, and ultimately redemption must be understood. When the prophets speak of Israel’s unfaithfulness, they do not use the language of courtroom guilt alone. They use the language of **adultery**, **defilement**, and **betrayal**.

If the covenant is marital, then its resolution cannot be legal abstraction. It must reckon honestly with the laws governing marriage, fidelity, jealousy, death, and release. This chapter argues that Christ does not resolve covenant rupture by standing outside the marriage as a third-party substitute, but by entering fully into it as the faithful husband who bears the covenant curse Himself.

This is not substitution detached from us. It is **participation unto death**, so that a genuinely new covenant can come into being.

## The Problem Stated Clearly: Can a Broken Marriage Be Renewed?

Jeremiah 31 presents a tension that cannot be ignored:

> “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers… which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them” (Jer. 31:31–32).

God identifies Himself as Israel’s husband, and He speaks in the past tense. The covenant has been broken. The marriage has been defiled.

Under the Law, a man may not simply reclaim a defiled wife and renew the same marriage covenant. Likewise, a high priest may not take a profaned woman as his bride. The law itself forecloses the possibility of covenant renewal through simple restoration.

This raises an unavoidable question: **How can God remain faithful to His own law and yet redeem His people?**

## New Covenant or Renewed Covenant?

The language of Jeremiah is decisive. The covenant to come is explicitly described as **not according to** the covenant made at Sinai. This is not a repair of the old structure, but the creation of something genuinely new.

The Hebrew word used for “new” in Jeremiah 31:31 is *ḥādāš* (H2319), not the word for repair or renewal. The same word describes a new king, new wine, a new wife, and new heavens and earth. In none of these contexts does “renewed” make sense.

The Greek translators of the Septuagint render this word with *kainos*, the term consistently used in the New Testament to denote newness in kind and quality. Hebrews explicitly draws the conclusion: in calling the covenant new, the former is rendered old and passing away.

This is not theological overprecision. It is covenant logic. A defiled marriage cannot simply be renewed without violating the law that governs it.

## The Law of the Jealous Husband

Numbers 5 outlines one of the most severe and revealing laws in the Torah: the law of jealousy. When a wife is suspected of infidelity, she must drink the water mixed with dust from the sanctuary floor. If she is guilty, the curse enters her body, producing visible decay, and she becomes a curse among her people.

This law matters because God repeatedly identifies Himself as a **jealous husband**. Israel’s idolatry is not merely disobedience. It is adultery.

According to the law, Israel should have drunk the cup.

But she does not.

Instead, in the Gospels, Jesus speaks of **a cup** He must drink, a cup that causes Him anguish and dread. At the cross, He drinks it fully.

The husband drinks the cup meant for the unfaithful wife.

## The Husband Bears the Curse

The curse of Numbers 5 is not abstract. It is embodied. The curse enters the body. It produces corruption and death.

At the cross, Christ’s body bears visible signs of curse and defilement. His body is broken. His side is pierced. His strength gives way. He is publicly displayed as one under curse.

Paul later states plainly: “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.”

This is not God venting wrath on a substitute. It is the faithful husband assuming the covenant consequences Himself in order to free the guilty bride.

The law is not ignored. It is fulfilled.

## Death as Covenant Release

Paul’s argument in Romans 7 is covenantal, not merely moral. A woman is bound to her husband so long as he lives. Only death releases her from the law of marriage.

Israel is bound to the Sinai covenant. The only lawful way out is death.

But Israel does not die.

The husband does.

By dying, Christ lawfully releases the bride from the covenant that held her in bondage. Resurrection does not restore the old marriage. It inaugurates a new one.

This is why participation is essential. One does not enter a new covenant by legal declaration alone, but by **dying and rising with the husband**.

## The High Priest and the New Bride

The Law of the High Priest forbids him from marrying a profaned or divorced woman. Christ, as High Priest, cannot simply reclaim Israel as she is.

The solution is not to lower the law, but to recreate the bride.

Through participation in Christ’s death and resurrection, the old identity dies. A new humanity emerges. The bride is made new, not repaired.

This is why baptism is consistently described as death and resurrection. It is not symbolic theater. It is covenant transition.

## Participation, Not External Substitution

If Christ merely suffered punishment instead of us, participation would be unnecessary. Faith would be reduced to mental assent.

But if Christ resolves covenant rupture by entering our condition, bearing the curse, dying, and rising as the faithful husband, then salvation necessarily involves participation.

We are not spectators of His death. We are united to it.

We do not receive life apart from His resurrection. We rise with Him.

---

## Conclusion: The Faithful Husband

The story Scripture tells is not primarily one of a judge satisfying legal penalties, but of a husband remaining faithful when the marriage has collapsed.

Christ does not abandon His bride. He does not ignore the law. He does not pretend the covenant was never broken.

He bears the curse.
He drinks the cup.
He dies.
And by dying, He frees.
By rising, He remarries.

The covenant instituted by Jesus Christ is not a renewal of Sinai. It is a genuinely new covenant, born out of death, resurrection, and faithful love.

This is not substitution without us.

It is participation unto life.
