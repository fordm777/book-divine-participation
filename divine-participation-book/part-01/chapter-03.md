# Chapter 3 — Death as Dominion

## From Exile to Rule

Genesis does not move directly from exile to resolution. Instead, it opens into a world where life continues outside the garden, yet no longer as it once was. Humanity is alive, but life is now fragile. Bodies decay. Fear emerges. The ground resists. Existence unfolds under limits.

What Scripture introduces next is not merely the fact that people die, but that death begins to rule. Death is not presented in Scripture as a single moment awaiting every human being at the end of life. It is presented as a power that enters human existence and governs it. This is how the apostle Paul consistently speaks.

In Romans 5, Paul does not say that death merely comes to all people. He says that death reigned. "Death reigned from Adam to Moses," exercising authority even over those whose sin did not mirror Adam's transgression. Death is described not as an outcome alone, but as a ruling force that establishes its authority within human life. Paul uses the same language elsewhere. In 1 Corinthians 15, death is named "the last enemy," an adversary to be destroyed rather than a sentence to be carried out. In Hebrews, humanity is described as held in lifelong slavery through fear of death, while the devil is said to wield the power of death as a means of domination. Across these texts, death is not passive. It acts, rules, enslaves, and governs.

This distinction is crucial. Death is not only what happens to people at the end of life. It is what reigns over people throughout life.

## Death as a Reigning Power

When Scripture describes death, it repeatedly uses the language of rule rather than punishment. Death "reigns." It has "dominion." Humanity is said to live under its authority. This language cannot be reduced to metaphor. If death were merely a penalty imposed for wrongdoing, it would not reign. Penalties are executed and completed. Dominion, by contrast, is ongoing. It governs how people conduct their lives, shaping their conduct through fear and establishing the conditions under which they live.

Yet Scripture is careful here. To say that death reigns is not to say that it determines or coerces every human action. A tyrant rules by threat and constraint, not by removing agency. Those under such rule still think, choose, resist, obey, and rebel, but they do so within boundaries set by a power greater than themselves. Death governs without annihilating human will.

This is precisely how the author of Hebrews describes the human condition. Humanity is not portrayed as inert or incapable, but as held in slavery through fear of death. Fear, not metaphysical inability, is the mechanism of control. Death rules by shaping desire and obedience, not by erasing agency.

Paul's own Christological language confirms this understanding. In Romans 8, he writes that God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh. Christ does not assume a dead humanity, nor an unreal one. He enters the same mortal, corruptible condition governed by death, yet without sin. The problem Christ confronts is not the absence of human life, but human life lived under death's reign.

Together, these texts reveal a consistent pattern. Death governs the world as a hostile power. It reigns over humanity, not by determining every action, but by establishing a regime of fear, decay, and loss. Humanity remains alive and active within this regime, yet not free from it. Death, in the biblical vision, is not simply the end of life. It is a hostile power that enters the world and begins to govern it from within.

This explains why Scripture consistently treats death as an enemy to be destroyed rather than a sentence to be affirmed. What reigns must be dethroned.

## Mortality and the Direction of Life

Mortality enters human existence when access to sustaining life is lost. Bodies return to dust. Life now moves toward an end. Yet mortality alone does not explain death's rule. Mortality describes the condition of human bodies, while death describes the authority that exploits that condition.

Human beings are not rendered lifeless by mortality. They continue to act, choose, desire, fear, and rebel. What changes is the direction of life itself. Existence becomes oriented toward decay. Corruption advances rather than heals. Fear of loss becomes a governing force. Mortality makes death possible; dominion explains why death becomes powerful.

## Living Persons in a Dying Condition

Scripture never describes fallen humanity as a collection of dead spirits inhabiting living bodies. That picture does not fit the narrative. After the fall, people continue to speak with God, respond to Him, resist Him, fear Him, and act against His will. They are alive, aware, and relational. Scripture never portrays humanity as inert or unresponsive.

What has changed is not human existence, but human location. Humanity now lives within a condition of bondage, life carried on under a foreign rule. Existence continues, but it does so within a realm governed by death, shaped by fear, and marked by captivity. This is why Scripture speaks in the language of slavery and dominion rather than annihilation. Humanity does not cease to live; it lives under something. The problem is not that the human spirit no longer exists, but that it exists within what Scripture later calls the domain of darkness. Human life unfolds within a kingdom that does not give life, even as it continues to demand obedience.

To be "dead" in this sense is not to be nonexistent. It is to live as a captive, active, willing, fearing, choosing, yet operating within a rule that was not chosen and cannot be escaped from within. Humanity becomes a living people in a dying state. Life continues, but it is now lived under decay, fear, and corruption. This is why Scripture can speak of people as "dead" even while they live. Death names the condition that governs life, not the absence of life itself.

This distinction matters. A dead thing cannot fear. A dead thing cannot hide. A dead thing cannot rebel. Scripture's diagnosis of the human condition assumes life under oppression, not annihilation.

## The Adversary and the Power of Death

Within this world governed by death, Scripture introduces the figure of the adversary. His authority is not rooted in creation or life-giving power. It is rooted in death. The adversary does not give life. He wields death. Jesus names this directly: "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy." Scripture describes him as holding the power of death and using fear as the means of enslavement. Humanity is not depicted as freely choosing his rule from a neutral position. It is depicted as living under a dominion that precedes conscious allegiance.

This is captivity language, not metaphysical determinism. The adversary functions not as humanity's origin, but as its captor. His authority is exercised through threat, accusation, fear, and the certainty of decay. Under this rule, human behavior begins to reflect the logic of death rather than the freedom of life.

## "Your Father the Devil": Dominion, Not Origin

When Scripture speaks of people doing the works of the devil or being "of" him, it is not describing spiritual origin. It is describing lordship. In the biblical world, works reveal rule. Those under a master enact the will of that master. Slaves perform the works of their lord even when they hate him. Allegiance is often enforced before it is chosen.

To say that humanity does the works of the devil is to say that humanity lives under his dominion. It does not mean humanity was created by him, regenerated by him, or ontologically derived from him. It means humanity exists within a regime shaped by death. This is the same logic by which Scripture later describes Israel living under Pharaoh. Pharaoh is not Israel's creator. He is Israel's captor.

## Satan, Immortality, and Fixed Corruption

A crucial contrast now emerges between humanity and the adversary. Human beings are mortal. They decay. Their existence moves toward an end. This means corruption, though real, is not permanent. It must reach a boundary.

The adversary, by contrast, is not described as mortal. He does not decay. He does not pass through death. His rebellion is therefore fixed. He exists as a spiritual being who is alive, but his life is lived within death, not beyond it, without an end that could open the possibility of restoration. This distinction is critical for the reader: the devil is not inert or extinct; he is a living spiritual reality whose existence is nevertheless bound to the realm of death, with no passage through it and no way out.

This difference explains why Scripture never speaks of the adversary's redemption. His condition is not bounded by mortality. Corruption, once embraced, becomes permanent. Mortality, therefore, is not humanity's curse alone. It is the condition that prevents humanity from becoming what the adversary has become.

## Death as Mercy and Threat

Scripture never treats death as good. It is consistently named an enemy, hostile to life, opposed to God's purposes, and destined to be destroyed. Yet Scripture also makes clear that death is permitted, not because it is desirable, but because something worse must be prevented.

Mortality ensures that corruption cannot become eternal. Unlike the adversary, whose rebellion is fixed and unending, humanity is bounded by decay and dissolution. Death brings an end to what is broken. It places a limit on corruption, preventing evil from becoming permanent. In this sense, death does not heal humanity, but it preserves the possibility of healing by keeping the human story open to divine intervention.

Without death, corruption would have no boundary. Fear, violence, and distortion would stretch endlessly forward. Existence itself would become an unending captivity, a life preserved without restoration, a permanence without hope. Mortality prevents that outcome. It guarantees that what is corrupted cannot last forever.

Yet death's presence within human life is not neutral. Once death enters as a ruling power, it becomes a tyrant. The certainty of loss reshapes desire. Fear becomes a tool of control. Choices are narrowed, obedience is coerced, and survival replaces trust. Humanity does not merely die at the end of life; humanity lives under the shadow of death throughout life.

This is how death enslaves. Not by annihilating human will, but by governing it through threat. Fear of loss becomes fear of obedience. Fear of death becomes submission to the power that wields it. Under such rule, life continues, but it is bent inward, guarded, anxious, and constrained.

Death therefore occupies a tragic double role. It is permitted as a boundary, yet it reigns as an oppressor. It restrains corruption even as it spreads fear. It keeps redemption possible even as it binds humanity in slavery. This tension defines the world after the garden. Death must exist so that corruption does not become eternal. Yet death must also be defeated, because life cannot flourish under its rule. The solution to the human problem cannot be the removal of death alone, nor can it be acceptance of death as final. What is required is something more difficult: death must be confronted, entered, and ultimately stripped of its authority.

Until that happens, humanity remains alive within a dying condition, preserved by mortality, yet ruled by fear.

## Humanity Born Under Dominion

Human beings are not born into a neutral world. They are born into a world already governed by death. No one chooses mortality. No one consents to decay. No one elects to live under fear. This condition precedes individual acts of rebellion. Humanity enters life already within a regime it did not establish.

This does not remove agency. It explains why agency is exercised under pressure. Slaves still choose, but their choices are shaped by the system that governs them. This is why Scripture describes the human problem as bondage rather than incapacity. Humanity is not inert. Humanity is enslaved.

## The Shape of the Problem

At this point, the contours of the human problem become clear. Humanity is alive, yet mortal. Life continues, yet corruption advances. Fear governs behavior. Death reigns as a power. The adversary rules through that power. This is not a courtroom scene awaiting a verdict. It is a kingdom exercising rule over slaves. Humanity lives enslaved within a foreign kingdom, under a ruler who exercises real claim over us.

The authority exercised within this foreign kingdom is not symbolic. It involves real claim. Jesus defines His own freedom in precisely these terms, saying that the ruler of this world had "nothing in Him," no ground on which to stand, no right of accusation, no claim upon His life. Humanity, by contrast, lives within a condition where such claim exists. Death provides the foothold. Fear enforces the rule. And slavery becomes the shape of life under that dominion.

This is exactly how the apostle Paul describes the human condition. When he says that humanity is "dead in trespasses and sins," he does not describe non-existence or incapacity. He immediately explains what he means: humanity once walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air. The dead are described as walking, acting, desiring, and obeying, but doing so under a governing power.

Death, in Paul's understanding, is not inactivity. It is subjection. To be "dead" is to live within a realm where another authority sets the terms of life. Human beings remain alive, responsive, and responsible, yet their lives unfold within a system governed by a ruler who does not give life.

What humanity requires, therefore, is not merely pardon, but deliverance. What must change is not only status, but lordship. Death must lose its authority. Fear must be broken. Captivity must end.

Scripture has a name for such an event. It calls it an exodus.

## Conclusion

Death does not merely await humanity at the end of life. It governs humanity throughout life, establishing a dominion in which fear becomes the mechanism of slavery, corruption advances, and the adversary exercises authority without giving life. This is precisely what the author of Hebrews describes when he writes that humanity was "held in slavery by their fear of death" throughout their lives. Yet death's rule is not absolute. It relies on mortality to function, and mortality itself ensures that corruption cannot become eternal. Humanity's condition, though dire, is not fixed. Life continues, and the story remains open.

The world that emerges after the garden is a world under death's reign. Humanity lives within it from birth, shaped by a power it did not choose. If freedom is to come, it cannot arrive as a verdict pronounced from a distance. A verdict cannot free those held by a master who will not let them go. Rescue must come as deliverance from a ruler. That rescue will not begin in a courtroom. It will require an exodus from this slavery and dominion.
