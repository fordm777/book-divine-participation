# Chapter 1 — Creation, Life, and the Presence of God

## Introduction

To understand what went wrong, we must first understand what was right. The opening chapters of Genesis reveal not merely a historical account of origins, but a theological vision of humanity's original state and intended destiny. At the heart of this vision is the presence of God—the source and sustainer of life itself.

The story begins with life, not death. It begins with presence, not absence. It begins with relationship, not alienation. Understanding this original state is essential, for only then can we grasp the nature of what was lost and what must be restored.

## Created in the Image of God

Genesis 1:26 records God's declaration: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." This dual language—image and likeness—was not lost on the early church. The Ante-Nicene Fathers, particularly in the Eastern tradition, recognized an important distinction between these two terms.

### The Image: What We Are by Creation

The **image of God** (imago Dei) refers to what is innate to humanity—part of our very creation. For the early Fathers such as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Athanasius, the image includes:

- **Rational nature**: The capacity to reason, to know, to understand
- **Free will**: The ability to choose, to love, to respond
- **Capacity for relationship**: The ability to commune with God and others

This image is considered **indelible**—even after the fall, humans still bear the image of God, though it may be damaged or obscured. The image is what makes us human, what distinguishes us from the rest of creation, and what cannot be completely erased.

### The Likeness: What We Are Destined to Become

The **likeness of God** (similitudo Dei) was understood differently. For many early Fathers, especially in the Eastern tradition, the likeness refers to something not yet complete, but a **goal**—the destiny of humanity.

The likeness refers to moral and spiritual growth into God's holiness and virtue—what Jesus spoke of in Matthew 5:48: "Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect." It is the process of becoming like God in character, in love, in holiness. Many Fathers, especially Irenaeus and later Eastern writers, saw this as the process of **theosis** (divinization)—becoming more like God by grace, a transformation perfected in Christ.

This understanding finds clear expression in the New Testament itself. Peter writes that through God's promises, we "may become partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). This is not about becoming God in essence, but about participating in the divine life—sharing in God's character, holiness, and love.

As Athanasius famously said: "God became man so that man might become god." Not in essence, but in character and participation in divine life. Christ doesn't just restore our lost state; he leads us into the likeness—holiness, love, and communion with God.

## Life in God's Presence

The original state of humanity was characterized by **life in God's presence**. This was not merely physical proximity, but relational intimacy. Adam and Eve walked with God in the garden, communing with him in the cool of the day. This presence was the source of life itself.

### Life as Participation

Life, in the biblical understanding, is not merely biological existence. It is **participation in the life of God**. To be alive is to be in relationship with the source of life. Death, then, is not merely the cessation of biological functions—it is separation from the source of life, alienation from God's presence.

The Tree of Life in the garden represents this reality. Access to the tree meant continued participation in God's life. To be cut off from the tree was to be cut off from the source of life itself.

### The Presence That Sustains

God's presence in the garden was not passive. It was active, sustaining, and life-giving. The presence of God:
- **Sustains life**: Without it, life cannot continue
- **Provides direction**: God's word guides and instructs
- **Offers relationship**: Communion and fellowship are possible
- **Imparts purpose**: Life has meaning in relationship to God

This presence was not something humanity earned or achieved. It was a gift, part of the original creation. Life in God's presence was the natural state, the intended condition of human existence.

## The Distinction Between Image and Likeness

The early church's distinction between image and likeness helps us understand both the original state and the intended destiny:

- **Image** = What we are by creation (rational, free, relational)
- **Likeness** = What we are destined to become (holy, loving, godlike in character)

This distinction matters because it shows that:
1. **We never lose the image**—we remain human, capable of relationship with God
2. **We are called to grow into the likeness**—transformation is possible and intended
3. **Christ restores both**—he renews the image and leads us into the likeness

The significance of this distinction becomes even clearer when we see how the language is used after the fall. Genesis 5:3 records that Adam "fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image." Here, the order is reversed from Genesis 1:26. Adam's children are born in **his likeness**—the likeness of fallen, corrupted humanity—rather than in God's likeness. This shows that the fall affected humanity's capacity to grow into God's likeness, even though the image of God remains.

In the West, particularly with Augustine and later medieval thought, this distinction often blurred—"image and likeness" were treated as synonyms. But in the East, the distinction remained clearer: **image is the starting gift, likeness is the goal of salvation in Christ**.

## Implications for Understanding the Fall

Understanding the original state—life in God's presence, created in his image with the destiny of likeness—helps us understand what was lost in the fall. It was not merely a legal violation or a moral failure. It was a **separation from the source of life**, a turning away from the presence that sustains.

The fall did not destroy the image—we remain human, created in God's image. But it damaged our capacity to grow into the likeness. It separated us from the presence that makes such transformation possible. And it introduced death—not as punishment, but as the natural consequence of separation from the source of life.

## Conclusion

The story begins with life, not death. It begins with presence, not absence. Humanity was created in the image of God, with the capacity for relationship and the destiny of growing into his likeness. Life was found in God's presence, in communion with the source of life itself.

This original state provides the foundation for understanding everything that follows. The fall, the exile, the bondage—all of these make sense only in light of what was originally intended. And the restoration, the redemption, the participation in Christ—all of these are about returning to this original state and fulfilling the intended destiny.

We were made for life in God's presence. That is where the story begins, and that is where it must ultimately return.
