# Chapter 24 — Why Translation Is Never Neutral

## Introduction: The Lanes Were Set Before You Read

Whatever framework you bring to the text will govern which semantic lanes you allow the words to travel in—whether you are reading English, Greek, or Hebrew.

This is the point most theological debates never reach.

Disagreements are often framed as conflicts between translations, or between English readers and those who appeal to the original languages. But beneath those disputes lies a more basic reality: **framework precedes definition**. Long before a reader asks what a word means, a framework has already determined which meanings feel possible, which feel obvious, and which feel implausible.

This chapter exists to make that dynamic visible.

## Frameworks Do Not Announce Themselves

A penal framework does not usually announce itself. It does not declare, “I am now interpreting this text legally.” It simply governs which meanings feel natural.

When readers approach Scripture assuming guilt must be punished, words like justice, wrath, and atonement instinctively move down punitive lanes. Other semantic possibilities remain technically available, but they feel strained, artificial, or evasive.

This is not because the language demands punishment, but because the framework does.

The reader experiences this not as interpretation, but as obviousness.

“Of course it means that.”  
“Of course this is what the word implies.”  

Of course it feels obvious. That’s how frameworks work.

## Why the Greek Does Not Rescue Us

At this point, many readers instinctively reach for the original languages.

“If we just get back to the Greek.”  
“If we just see what the Hebrew really says.”  

These instincts are understandable. They are also insufficient.

Greek and Hebrew words do not float free of conceptual worlds. They, too, are heard through frameworks. A reader who brings a penal imagination to the Greek text will still gravitate toward punitive meanings, even when the lexical range allows for cleansing, healing, restoration, or liberation.

So even the Greek doesn’t rescue us if our framework is wrong.

Lexicons list semantic ranges. They do not tell the reader which range to inhabit. Grammar constrains meaning, but it does not dictate theology. Two readers can work from the same Greek text, the same lexicon, and the same syntax—and still hear entirely different things—because they are listening from different worlds.

## Translation as Lane Selection

Translation does not merely transfer meaning from one language to another. It selects which semantic lane will be paved and which will be narrowed.

Biblical terms often carry multiple metaphors at once:
- legal
- covenantal
- ritual
- relational
- therapeutic
- cosmic

Ancient languages can hold these together with remarkable flexibility. English often cannot. When a translator must choose a single word, that choice inevitably foregrounds one metaphor and backgrounds others.

Once that choice is repeated across verses, books, and centuries, the metaphor hardens into a framework. The framework then feels biblical simply because it is familiar.

This is not corruption. It is inheritance.

## Why Translation Debates Never Settle Theology

If translation were neutral, theological disagreement would end with better dictionaries.

It does not.

Because the real disagreement is not about what a word *can* mean, but about what kind of world the reader believes Scripture is describing.

Is salvation primarily:
- legal resolution or liberation?
- punishment absorbed or death defeated?
- satisfaction rendered or life restored?

Translation choices tend to follow answers to those questions, not settle them.

## The Feedback Loop We Rarely Notice

Once a framework governs translation, a feedback loop forms.

- The translation reinforces the framework  
- The framework explains the translation  
- Alternative readings feel unnatural  
- Objections sound like evasions  

At that point, the reader is no longer aware of interpreting. They feel as though they are simply repeating what Scripture says.

The framework disappears from view, and certainty takes its place.

## Learning to Read Without Escape Routes

This chapter closes several common escape routes.

It prevents the reader from saying:
- “That’s just an English problem.”
- “The Greek clears this up.”
- “You’re reading too much into words.”

It asks the reader to consider something more demanding:  
*What if the difficulty is not the language, but the world we assume the language must inhabit?*

## Conclusion: Awareness Before Agreement

Translation is not betrayal.  
But it is never neutral.

Every reader stands inside a framework before the text is opened. That framework quietly governs which meanings feel faithful and which feel foreign.

Faithful reading does not require abandoning English, nor mastering Greek and Hebrew, nor distrusting translators. It requires **awareness**—awareness of the lenses we bring, the lanes we open, and the worlds we assume.

Only with that awareness can Scripture be allowed to challenge not just our answers, but the questions we thought were obvious.

And that, ultimately, is where real theological renewal begins.
