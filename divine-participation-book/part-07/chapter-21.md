# Chapter 21 — Needs-Based Christianity: When the Gospel Became Therapeutic

## Introduction: A Gospel That No Longer Requires Death

There is a form of Christianity that speaks constantly of grace, love, acceptance, and healing—and yet quietly avoids death. It promises help without burial, comfort without crucifixion, and life without participation in Christ’s death. This form of Christianity has become so normalized in the modern West that many believers assume it *is* the gospel.

But it is not.

It is better described as **needs-based Christianity**: a therapeutic framework in which Christ is presented primarily as the one who meets emotional, psychological, relational, or circumstantial needs, rather than as the one who **delivers humanity from the dominion of death through death itself**.

This chapter is not written to mock sincere believers. Many who inhabit this framework truly desire God. But desire alone does not determine formation. The question is not whether people are seeking help, but **what story they are being initiated into**.

The apostles did not preach a gospel of coping.  
They preached a gospel of crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.

## From Deliverance to Management

In the apostolic proclamation, the human problem is not framed primarily as unmet needs, damaged self-esteem, or lack of purpose. It is framed as **bondage** to sin, fear, and death.

Paul does not say humanity needs encouragement.  
He says humanity needs liberation.

Yet needs-based Christianity subtly reframes the problem. Death is no longer a tyrant to be destroyed, but a background condition to be managed. Sin is no longer a dominion to be escaped, but a weakness to be accommodated. Salvation becomes less about ontological transition and more about **emotional stabilization**.

The gospel is no longer announced as:

> “You are a captive of death and must die and be raised in newness of life.”

It is re-presented as:

> “You are accepted, and now Christ will help you cope.”

This shift does not happen all at once. It happens when **death disappears from the center of the gospel**, and resurrection is reduced to metaphor.

## “Come as You Are” and the Loss of the Threshold

The phrase “come as you are” is often defended as an expression of grace. In a limited sense, it is true: no one cleans themselves before coming to Christ. But when this phrase is allowed to function as a *summary of the gospel*, it becomes profoundly misleading.

In Scripture, people do come as they are, but this statement is often softened in ways that still obscure the truth. It is commonly followed by the reassurance that *“they do not remain as they are.”* While this sounds corrective, it can still mislead if left undefined.

The issue is not merely that a person changes after coming to Christ.  
The issue is that the person who comes to Christ **does not survive the encounter**.

The apostolic gospel does not describe salvation as the gradual improvement of an existing identity. It describes salvation as **the death and burial of that identity**, followed by the emergence of a new one.

What is left out by softer language is the necessary rupture.

In Scripture, the one who comes to Christ:
- is crucified with Him  
- is buried with Him  
- passes out of a former dominion  

Only then does Christ bring forth what Scripture calls *new creation*—not a repaired self, not a rehabilitated self, but a self that comes **out of the grave** in newness of life.

The problem is not the invitation.  
The problem is what has been removed from it.

In the apostolic witness, coming to Christ always involves a **threshold**:

- death to the old man  
- burial with Christ  
- release from a former dominion  

When that threshold disappears, initiation into Christ is replaced with **affirmation of the self**. The gospel becomes a reassurance that one is safe, valued, and welcomed without ever requiring the death of the one being welcomed.

What once marked the **end of an identity** now becomes the __preservation__ of it.

## Therapy Is Not Healing

Needs-based Christianity often borrows its language from therapeutic culture. This is not accidental. Therapy, by design, aims to help people function *within* their present condition. It seeks stability, coping mechanisms, and resilience.

The gospel does something entirely different.

Therapy asks:

> “How can I live better in this condition?”

The gospel asks:

> “How do I die out of this condition entirely?”

The early church did not view salvation as God helping humanity manage death more gently. They understood salvation as **God destroying death by leading humanity through it**.

This is why death itself was never treated as the cure. Death was the disease. And yet paradoxically, death became the pathway to healing—because passing *through* death with Christ is the only way out of death’s dominion.

Therapeutic Christianity tries to heal wounds **while leaving death intact**.  
The gospel heals wounds by **killing the thing that causes them**.

## A Gospel Without Participation

Once the problem is redefined as unmet need rather than bondage, participation becomes unnecessary.

If salvation is reassurance, then:

- baptism becomes symbolic at best  
- obedience becomes optional  
- transformation becomes gradual self-improvement  
- faith becomes mental assent or trust in outcomes  

But the apostolic gospel insists on participation:

- participation in Christ’s death  
- participation in His burial  
- participation in His resurrection  

Paul does not say we are saved *because* Christ died.  
He says we are saved *by dying with Him*.

Needs-based Christianity keeps Christ’s death safely external. It is something He did “for us” so that we do not have to do anything disruptive ourselves. The cross becomes inspirational rather than participatory.

But a cross that does not crucify **you** is no longer the cross of Christ.

## Why This Produces Burnout, Not Freedom

One of the great ironies of needs-based Christianity is that it promises rest but often produces exhaustion.

Why?

Because people are asked to live the Christian life **without ever having died out of the old one**.

They are told:

- they are forgiven, but not freed  
- accepted, but not released  
- loved, but still trapped  

So they try to:

- manage sin rather than escape it  
- cope with fear rather than conquer it  
- discipline the flesh rather than crucify it  

This inevitably leads to cycles of guilt, striving, collapse, and recommitment. The burden remains because **the old man is still alive**, and the old dominion still claims authority.

The gospel of participation, by contrast, begins with burial. And what has been buried does not need to be managed.

## Death as Mercy Revisited

Earlier chapters established that death is not punishment but mercy—that mortality itself prevents sin from becoming immortal. Needs-based Christianity quietly reverses this logic.

It treats death as something to be delayed emotionally, avoided spiritually, and softened psychologically. But Scripture treats death as something to be **entered rightly** so that it may lose its power.

Christ does not rescue humanity *from* death by bypassing it.  
He rescues humanity *through* death by transforming it.

Any gospel that avoids this logic will inevitably try to **preserve life as it is**, rather than allow it to be surrendered.

## The Subtle Shift in the Character of God

When salvation is framed as therapeutic reassurance, God is subtly reshaped.

He becomes:

- primarily affirming  
- perpetually patient  
- endlessly accommodating  

But not:

- invasive  
- disruptive  
- deadly to the old self  

The God of Scripture does not merely comfort humanity.  
He **terminates** what cannot be healed.

This is not cruelty. It is surgery.

A God who refuses to kill death is not merciful. He is negligent.

## Conclusion: The Gospel Is Not Help — It Is Deliverance

Needs-based Christianity asks:

> “What do you need from Jesus?”

The gospel asks:

> “What must die so that you may live?”

One begins with the self and seeks divine assistance.  
The other begins with Christ and demands surrender.

The early church did not invite people to bring their lives to Christ for improvement. They invited people to **lose their lives entirely**, trusting that resurrection would follow.

The gospel does not exist to help humanity survive death more comfortably.  
It exists to **destroy death altogether**.

Any Christianity that removes death from its center may sound compassionate—but it cannot set anyone free.
