# Chapter 21 — Hijacked Words: How Meaning Drift Reshaped Theology

## Introduction: Why This Argument Keeps Failing

Theological debates over words like wrath, propitiation, atonement, and justice usually collapse into one of two positions.

One side insists, “The word clearly means this.”  
The other responds, “The English word is wrong. The Greek or Hebrew means something else.”

Both sides believe they are protecting Scripture.  
Both sides believe the other is distorting it.

What neither side usually sees is that **the word itself has changed**, and theology changed with it.

This chapter does not argue that English is unbiblical, nor that Greek magically resolves disagreement. It demonstrates something more uncomfortable: **theological commitments reshaped the meanings of key words**, and once reshaped, those words began to reshape theology in return.

This is not neutral development. It is not harmless. And it especially matters for words that now carry heavy doctrinal weight.

## Propitiation: From Cleansing to Appeasement

No word better illustrates theological hijacking than *propitiation*.

### The Earlier Meaning

In classical and early Christian usage, the Greek terms translated as propitiation (*hilaskomai*, *hilastērion*) belong to the **temple world**, not the courtroom.

The standard Greek lexicon of the early modern period, **Liddell–Scott**, defines *hilaskomai* as:

> “to render gracious; to conciliate; to cleanse”

And *hilastērion* as:

> “a means of expiation; the place of propitiation”

Notably absent is any reference to punishment or appeased anger. The word names **the removal of what obstructs communion**, not the satisfaction of wrath through penalty.

This aligns with how the term functions in the Septuagint and in Hebrews, where *hilastērion* refers to the **mercy seat**, the place of cleansing where God meets his people.

### The English Shift

Early English usage reflects this same world.

**Webster’s Dictionary (1828)** defines propitiation as:

> “The act of appeasing anger; conciliation; the act of making favorable.”

But when applied theologically, Webster adds:

> “That which propitiates; an atonement; that which expiates sin and restores the sinner to divine favor.”

The direction is important. Propitiation restores **the sinner** to favor. It does not describe punishment inflicted to change God’s emotional state.

Even in the nineteenth century, the word still operated within a **restorative framework**.

### The Theological Pressure

As penal substitution theology developed, propitiation was increasingly forced to carry a different load.

It came to mean:
- appeasement of divine wrath
- satisfaction of retributive justice
- the calming of God through punishment

At this point, the modern debate emerges.

One reader says, “Propitiation means appeasement. That’s what the word says.”  
Another replies, “No, the Greek doesn’t mean that.”

But the historical record shows something else: **the word was trained to mean appeasement by theology**, not by Scripture alone.

The theology came first. The meaning followed.

## Atonement: From Reconciliation to Accounting

The English word *atonement* did not enter theology through Greek or Hebrew. It was coined.

William Tyndale formed the word to express reconciliation—*at one-ment*.

The **Oxford English Dictionary** records its earliest meaning as:

> “Reconciliation; concord; agreement.”

**Webster (1828)** likewise defines atonement primarily as:

> “Reconciliation; restoration of friendly relations after disagreement or enmity.”

Only later does expiation appear, and even then without penal definition.

### The Drift

As salvation increasingly became framed in legal and economic categories, atonement absorbed those assumptions.

It began to signify:
- debt payment
- legal satisfaction
- punishment rendered to balance accounts

Modern readers now assume this meaning is obvious.

But historically, it is not.

Here again, theology reshaped the word, and the reshaped word reinforced the theology. What began as reconciliation became accounting.

## Wrath: From Revealed Consequence to Internal Emotion

Early biblical usage treats wrath as something **revealed**, not vented.

Paul speaks of wrath being revealed as God “gives people over” to corruption and death. Wrath names exposure to reality when covenant protection is withdrawn.

**Jamieson–Fausset–Brown** observes:

> “Wrath, in Scripture, often denotes the punitive consequences of sin rather than a passion in God.”

But English usage increasingly emphasized wrath as **emotional anger**, and theology leaned into that emotional register.

Once wrath is imagined primarily as divine rage, salvation must be reframed as a way to **remove God’s anger** rather than heal humanity’s condition.

Here the word’s emotional drift reshaped the problem salvation was thought to solve.

---

## Justice: From Restoration to Retribution

Biblical justice sets things right. It restores order by restoring life.

**Webster (1828)** defines justice as:

> “The giving to every one his due; conformity to truth and right.”

Punishment is not central. Rectitude is.

Yet as legal frameworks hardened, justice narrowed until it was nearly synonymous with penalty. Once that happened, mercy and justice were forced into competition.

Justice became something that must be satisfied *before* restoration, rather than the means by which restoration occurs.

---

## How the Trap Was Set

Once these words drifted, they began to reinforce one another.

Wrath became anger.  
Justice demanded punishment.  
Atonement became payment.  
Propitiation became appeasement.

At that point, the system became self-confirming. Scripture was read through the grid, and the grid was treated as biblical simply because the words appeared there.

This is why debates stall.

One side defends the English word.  
The other side rejects the English word.  
Neither side asks how the word arrived at its modern meaning—or what theology trained it to get there.

## Conclusion: Words Cannot Be Recovered Without Memory

These words are not the enemy.  
Nor is translation the villain.

The danger lies in **forgetting how meanings formed**, and assuming the present sense is the natural one.

When memory is lost:
- death becomes punishment instead of enemy
- salvation becomes accounting instead of participation
- God becomes the obstacle rather than the healer

Recovering these words requires recovering their world.

Not a new theology, but an older memory.

And once that memory is restored, Scripture begins to sound like good news again—not legal relief, but the announcement that life has returned.
