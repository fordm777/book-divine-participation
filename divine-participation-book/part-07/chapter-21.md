# Chapter 21 — Needs-Based Christianity: When the Gospel Became Therapeutic

## Introduction: A Gospel That No Longer Requires Death

In many churches, the gospel is frequently proclaimed in therapeutic terms. People are invited to “come as you are,” and are assured that Jesus will help them change, grow through discipleship, and in some cases receive healing through dedicated ministries. These ways of speaking are familiar and often well-intended. Yet they tend to frame salvation primarily as assistance and improvement after believing in Jesus.

This framing has become so normalized in modern evangelical and Protestant churches that many believers assume it *is* the gospel.

But is this really the gospel proclaimed by Jesus and the Apostles?  
Is something essential missing?

When Christ is presented primarily as the one who meets emotional, psychological, relational, or circumstantial needs, a particular framework is formed. Salvation is understood less as deliverance from a dominion, and more as ongoing help within one’s existing life. Growth becomes improvement. Healing becomes emotional stabilization. Discipleship becomes management of the self over time.

This therapeutic framework may be described as **needs-based Christianity**.

This chapter is not written to mock sincere believers who may inhabit this framework and truly desire God. But desire alone does not determine how the gospel is understood or lived. The question is not whether people are seeking help, but **what story they are being initiated into**, and how that story quietly shapes their expectations, instincts, and sense of what the Christian life is meant to be.

The apostolic gospel tells a different story. Christ is not presented merely as the one who helps humanity cope, but as the one who **delivers humanity from the dominion of death through death itself**. Salvation is not framed as improvement after belief, but as **participation in Christ’s death and resurrection**, followed by the renewing of the mind.

The apostles did not preach a gospel of fixing the old man under the dominion of death.  
They preached a gospel of crucifixion, burial, and resurrection, so that a new life might be lived no longer under the dominion of death.

## From Deliverance to Management

In the apostolic proclamation, the human problem is not framed primarily as unmet needs, damaged self-esteem, or lack of purpose. It is framed as **bondage** to sin, fear, and death.

Paul does not say humanity needs encouragement.  
He says humanity needs liberation.

Needs-based Christianity subtly reframes the problem. Death is no longer a tyrant to be destroyed, but a background condition to be managed. Sin is no longer a dominion to be escaped, but a weakness to be accommodated. Salvation becomes less about ontological transition and more about **emotional stabilization**.

The gospel is no longer announced as:

> “You are a captive of death and must die and be raised in newness of life.”

It is re-presented as:

> “You are accepted, and now Christ will help you cope.”

This shift does not happen all at once. It happens when **death disappears from the center of the gospel**, and resurrection is reduced to metaphor.

## “Come as You Are” and the Loss of the Threshold

The phrase “come as you are” is often defended as an expression of grace. In a limited sense, it is true: no one cleans themselves before coming to Christ. But when this phrase is allowed to function as a *summary of the gospel*, it becomes profoundly misleading.

In Scripture, people do come as they are, but this statement is often softened in ways that still obscure the truth. It is commonly followed by the reassurance that *“they do not remain as they are.”* While this sounds corrective, it can still mislead if left undefined.

The issue is not merely that a person changes after coming to Christ.  
The issue is that the person who comes to Christ **does not survive the encounter**.

The apostolic gospel does not describe salvation as the gradual improvement of an existing identity. It describes salvation as **the death and burial of that identity**, followed by the emergence of a new one.

What is left out by softer language is the necessary rupture.

In Scripture, the one who comes to Christ:
- is crucified with Him  
- is buried with Him  
- passes out of a former dominion  

Only then does Christ bring forth what Scripture calls *new creation*, not a repaired self, not a rehabilitated self, but a self that comes **out of the grave** in newness of life.

The problem is not the invitation.  
The problem is what has been removed from it.

In the apostolic witness, coming to Christ always involves a **threshold**:

- death to the old man  
- burial with Christ  
- release from a former dominion  

When that threshold disappears, initiation into Christ is replaced with **affirmation of the self**. The gospel becomes a reassurance that one is safe, valued, and welcomed, without ever requiring the death of the one being welcomed.

What once marked the **end of an identity** now becomes the preservation of it.

## Therapy Is Not Healing

Needs-based Christianity often borrows its language from therapeutic culture. This is not accidental. Therapy, by design, aims to help people function *within* their present condition. It seeks stability, coping mechanisms, and resilience.

The gospel does something entirely different.

Therapy asks:

> “How can I live better in this condition?”

The gospel asks:

> “How do I die out of this condition entirely?”

The early church did not view salvation as God helping humanity manage death more gently. They understood salvation as **God destroying death by leading humanity through it**.

This only makes sense if death itself is understood rightly. Scripture does not present death as God’s final solution, but as a temporary mercy that restrains corruption and prevents sin from becoming immortal. Death limits evil; it does not justify it.

Needs-based Christianity quietly reverses this logic. It treats death as something to be delayed emotionally, avoided spiritually, and softened psychologically. Healing becomes the art of making death livable.

The gospel does the opposite. It teaches people how to enter death rightly with Christ, so that death may lose its power altogether. Christ does not rescue humanity from death by bypassing it. He rescues humanity through death by transforming it.

Therapeutic Christianity tries to heal the person **while leaving the person in death**.  
The gospel heals wounds by **killing the thing that causes them**.

## A Gospel Without Participation

Once the problem is redefined as unmet need rather than bondage, participation becomes unnecessary.

If salvation is reassurance, then:
- baptism becomes symbolic at best  
- obedience becomes optional  
- transformation becomes gradual self-improvement  
- faith becomes mental assent or trust in outcomes  

But the apostolic gospel insists on participation:
- participation in Christ’s death  
- participation in His burial  
- participation in His resurrection  

Paul does not frame salvation as something that happens merely *because* Christ died, as though His death were an external transaction applied from a distance. He consistently frames salvation as something that happens *by participation*, specifically **by dying with Christ**.

> “Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?”  
> (Romans 6:3, KJV)

> “Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”  
> (Romans 6:4, KJV)

> “For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection.”  
> (Romans 6:5, KJV)

Salvation is not applied to those who remain alive in Adam. It is entered only through death.

> “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.”  
> (Galatians 2:20, KJV)

> “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”  
> (2 Corinthians 5:17, KJV)

The old does not improve.  
The old **passes away**.

Christ’s death is not merely something that benefits us. It is something we are called to **enter**. Apart from dying with Him, there is no resurrection life to receive.

Needs-based Christianity keeps Christ’s death safely external. The cross becomes inspirational rather than participatory.

But a cross that does not crucify **you** is no longer the cross of Christ.

## Why This Produces Burnout, Not Freedom

One of the great ironies of needs-based Christianity is that it promises rest, but often produces exhaustion.

Why?

Because people are asked to live the Christian life **without ever having died out of the old one**.

They are told:
- they are forgiven, but not freed  
- accepted, but not released  
- loved, but still trapped  

So they try to:
- manage sin rather than escape it  
- cope with fear rather than conquer it  
- discipline the flesh rather than crucify it  

This leads to cycles of guilt, striving, collapse, and recommitment. The burden remains because people are taught to manage patterns of life that belong to a dominion they have never fully exited.

The gospel of participation, by contrast, begins with burial. And what has been buried does not need to be managed.

Paul’s language is precise:

> “That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  
> And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;  
> And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.”  
> (Ephesians 4:22–24, KJV)

The *former conversation* refers to habits and patterns learned under a former dominion. These do not constitute the old man himself, but they were shaped by him. What is renewed is not the old man, but the *spirit of the mind*. Renewal follows burial, it does not replace it.

This pattern is already present in the Old Testament. Israel was truly delivered from Egypt. Pharaoh’s dominion was broken. Yet Egypt remained
