Response 1

Yes—within Reformed / Calvinist theology the unelect are understood as unable to receive the Word savingly apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. This is rooted in the doctrines of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace. The unelect hear the Word outwardly but do not embrace it in faith, because saving faith is a gift given only to the elect.

Here are some representative quotes:
John Calvin

    “All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation… Accordingly, as each has been created for one or the other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life or to death.”
    (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.21.5)

    “The reprobate, by the just but inscrutable judgment of God, are excluded from access to the Word of life and from the sanctification of the Spirit.”
    (Institutes, 3.24.1)

Canons of Dort (1619) – Reformed Confessional Standard

    “That some receive the gift of faith from God, and others do not receive it proceeds from God’s eternal decree… According to which decree, He graciously softens the hearts of the elect… but leaves the non-elect in His just judgment to their own wickedness and obduracy.”
    (Canons of Dort, I.6)

    “Faith is therefore to be considered as the gift of God… because He confers it on whom He will, when He will, and how He will.”
    (Canons of Dort, III/IV.14)

Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)

    “By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life; and others foreordained to everlasting death.”
    (WCF, 3.3)

    “The rest of mankind, God was pleased… to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of His glorious justice.”
    (WCF, 3.7)

Jonathan Edwards

    “The elect are distinguished from the rest of mankind, not by their nature, nor by any good qualifications that are in them, but only by the free grace of God. The rest are left to perish in their natural state.”
    (The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners)

✅ So the Reformed view is:

    The elect are given ears to hear and hearts to believe when God effectually calls them.

    The unelect may hear the preaching of the Word externally, but they are not enabled to receive it savingly, because the Spirit withholds regenerating grace.

Would you like me to also pull scriptural passages that Reformed theologians use to defend this doctrine (e.g., John 6:44, Romans 8:7-8, 1 Cor. 2:14)?

Yes — in classic Reformed theology / Calvinism, one of the central teachings is that the unelect are unable to receive the word savingly. This comes directly from the doctrines of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace (two of the "Five Points of Calvinism").

The belief is that all people, by nature, are spiritually dead in sin and therefore unable to respond positively to God’s word apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. The elect will be enabled to believe; the non-elect remain hardened.

Here are some representative quotes from Reformed theologians and confessions:
John Calvin

    “All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life or to death.”
    (Institutes of the Christian Religion, 3.21.5)

    “The human will does not obtain grace by freedom, but obtains freedom by grace… Man is so enslaved by the yoke of sin that he cannot of his own nature aim at good either in wish or in actual pursuit.”
    (Institutes, 2.3.4)

Canons of Dort (1619)

    “All men are conceived in sin and are by nature children of wrath, incapable of any saving good, prone to evil, dead in sin, and in bondage thereto; and without the regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit, they are neither willing nor able to return to God, to reform the depravity of their nature, or even to dispose themselves to reformation.”
    (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Article 3)

Westminster Confession of Faith (1646)

    “Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto.”
    (WCF, Chapter IX, section 3)

Jonathan Edwards (Calvinist preacher, Freedom of the Will)

    “The will is always determined by the strongest motive, and since the natural man loves darkness rather than light, until God gives him a new heart, he will never choose Christ.”

✅ So to answer directly:
Yes, Reformed theologians believe the unelect are unable to receive the word savingly (though they can hear it outwardly). Only those whom God has elected and regenerated by the Spirit will be able to respond with true faith.

Would you like me to also pull Scripture passages Reformed theologians use to support this (like John 6:44, 1 Cor 2:14, Rom 8:7–8), along with how they interpret them?
