**User:**

I have a question regarding the greek word "for" in Acts 2:38 in particular.

I noticed that people are writing articles like the following:
https://www.scripturesubjects.net/blog-questions/doesnt-acts-238-prove-baptism-forgives-sin
and 
https://www.gotquestions.org/baptism-Acts-2-38.html

Where they state the word "for" can be "because of".  According to my understanding of the Greek word translated to english as "for" it is directional.

It is denoting entrance into, or direction and limit: into, to, toward, for, among

it seems people are either use the english word "for" and then attempting to confuse people with the synomyms in english and trying to force that into the greek

Great question — this gets right to the heart of the debate around Acts 2:38.

Here’s the key Greek text in question:

    μετανοήσατε, καὶ βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν

The phrase under debate is εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν (“for the forgiveness of your sins”).
1. The Greek preposition εἰς

    Primary meaning: movement into, toward, leading to a result.

    Often denotes purpose or result, not “because of.”

    In the NT, εἰς + accusative overwhelmingly points forward (directional or goal-oriented).

Examples:

    Matthew 26:28 — “This is my blood… poured out εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν” (“for the forgiveness of sins”). Clearly not “because of forgiveness,” but “in order to bring about forgiveness.”

    Romans 10:10 — “with the heart one believes εἰς δικαιοσύνην” (“unto righteousness”). Again, forward-looking.

2. Does εἰς ever mean “because of”?

    In very rare cases, context can shade εἰς toward “because of” (causal), but these are exceptions.

    Example often cited: Matthew 12:41 — “They repented εἰς the preaching of Jonah.” Some argue it means “because of,” though many grammarians still see it as “at/unto” (they repented in relation to Jonah’s preaching).

So while possible, it’s not the normal usage of εἰς.
3. Why the debate in Acts 2:38?

    Sacramentalist view (Catholic, Orthodox, some Protestants): εἰς = “in order to obtain.” Baptism is connected directly with forgiveness.

    Evangelical / Baptist view: try to avoid sacramental reading, so some argue εἰς = “because of,” meaning “be baptized because your sins are forgiven.”

    Grammatically, though, the “because of” reading is the exception, not the rule.

4. The nuance of English “for”

You’re right — much confusion comes from relying on the English “for,” which can mean either:

    “for the purpose of” (directional, goal), or

    “because of” (causal, backward-looking).

When translators put “for” in English Bibles, it opens the door for people to force the causal sense from English back into the Greek — even though εἰς almost always points forward.

✅ Summary:
You’re correct that εἰς is directional/goal-oriented — “into, unto, toward, for the purpose of.”
The claim that Acts 2:38 means “be baptized because your sins are forgiven” is an interpretive move driven by theology, not Greek grammar.
The plain Greek reading is: *“Repent and be baptized … *unto/for the forgiveness of your sins.”

Would you like me to break down how Greek scholars (e.g., A.T. Robertson, Daniel Wallace, BDAG lexicon) handle this verse, so you can have citations to back your point when people argue the “because of” view?
