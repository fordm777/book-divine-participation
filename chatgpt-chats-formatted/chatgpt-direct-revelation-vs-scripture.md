# Direct Revelation Vs Scripture

**User:**

was there a group of people during the 1st century and possibly the ante-nicene period, where said group would view the scriptures as only if one specifically hears from God directly on which or what part to obey or follow, does this question make sense?  I thought the early church and apostles seemed to hold to the scriptures as the word of God and obey

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, your question makes perfect sense — and you’re touching on a subtle but important issue that did emerge in the first few centuries of Christianity: the relationship between direct revelation ("hearing from God") and the authority of Scripture.

Let’s unpack it carefully.
1. The Apostolic and Early Church View

In the 1st century, the apostles and early believers generally viewed the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) as the Word of God, authoritative and binding. When they quoted Scripture, they often prefaced it with “It is written…” (Greek: gegraptai), a phrase that meant “God has spoken.”

    Jesus Himself said, “Scripture cannot be broken” (John 10:35).

    Paul wrote, “All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable…” (2 Timothy 3:16).

    The early Church Fathers, like Clement of Rome (late 1st century), Ignatius of Antioch, and Polycarp, consistently treated Scripture as divinely authoritative.

So yes — the mainstream early church (especially apostolic and ante-Nicene writers) held that Scripture was God’s revealed word and to be obeyed.
2. Groups That Prioritized “Direct Revelation” Over Scripture

However, your question is insightful because there were movements in the 1st–3rd centuries who did believe that only direct revelation from God (through the Spirit) was the true guide, and that Scripture was secondary or even irrelevant unless confirmed personally by divine illumination.

These groups include:
a. The Gnostics (1st–3rd centuries)

    Claimed that divine truth came through special revelation — “gnosis” — rather than through the public Scriptures.

    Many Gnostics reinterpreted Scripture symbolically or rejected parts of it outright, saying it could only be rightly understood through personal enlightenment from the divine spark within.

    For them, truth was “heard” or “revealed” individually by God or an emanation (like the Aeons), not received communally through Scripture.

b. The Montanists (late 2nd century)

    Founded by Montanus with Priscilla and Maximilla, this movement believed the Holy Spirit continued to speak directly through prophets.

    Montanus’ followers claimed new revelations from the Spirit that could even supersede or interpret Scripture.

    They emphasized that the Paraclete (the Spirit) was speaking now — not just through the written word.

    Tertullian later joined this movement, saying the “New Prophecy” was the continuation of divine revelation.

So yes, the Montanists might fit your description quite well — they believed obedience came through hearing directly from God, and Scripture was important but incomplete without the Spirit’s current voice.
c. Some Early Mystical or Ascetic Groups

Certain Encratites, Hermetic-influenced Christians, and later Desert Fathers also leaned toward a view that emphasized direct inner revelation — though most still respected Scripture.
They tended to say: Scripture is true, but only the spiritually mature, those illuminated by the Spirit, can truly discern what God means to them.
3. The Orthodox Christian Response

Writers like Irenaeus (Against Heresies, late 2nd century) and Tertullian (before he joined Montanism) strongly opposed such ideas:

    Irenaeus insisted that Scripture and apostolic tradition together were the measure of truth, not private revelations.

    He criticized Gnostics for claiming special insight and “hearing from God” apart from the apostolic teaching.

In short, the orthodox line of thought was:

    “Yes, the Spirit speaks — but never in contradiction to the Scriptures He inspired.”

✅ Summary

To directly answer your question:

| Period | Group | View of Scripture | View of “hearing from God” |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Century Apostolic Church | Mainstream Christianity | Authoritative, to be obeyed | Spirit illuminates but does not override Scripture |
| 2nd Century Gnostics | Often rejected or reinterpreted Scripture | Direct revelation (gnosis) is superior |  |
| 2nd Century Montanists | Accepted Scripture but added new revelations | Spirit speaks new commands or guidance |  |
| Ante-Nicene Fathers (Orthodox) | Scripture + Apostolic tradition authoritative | Personal revelation must align with Scripture |  |


If I understand you correctly, you’re asking whether any group held the view that “Scripture only applies if God personally tells me to obey it.”
👉 The answer is yes — that mentality shows up most clearly in Gnostic and Montanist circles, not in the mainstream apostolic or ante-Nicene church.

Would you like me to quote a few primary sources (like from Irenaeus or Tertullian) where they describe this “Spirit over Scripture” mentality in their opponents? That would make it even clearer how these ideas were understood at the time.

**User:**

now, to be clear, the apostles and ante-nicene period, did not reject individual revelation, but that revelation would not contradict the scripture and doctrine delivered from the apostles?

Also, the early church never taught to only obey jesus only if you hear some thing from the 'spirit'?

**ChatGPT:**

Exactly right — and your understanding here is spot-on.

Let’s confirm both of those points clearly and with historical grounding.
🕊️ 1. The Apostles and Early Church Did Not Reject Personal Revelation

They fully affirmed that the Holy Spirit continues to speak, guide, and reveal, but always within the bounds of what had already been revealed through Christ and the apostles.

Examples:

    Acts 13:2 – The Holy Spirit says, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul…” — this is a personal revelation to a local church, but it builds upon the apostolic mission, not against it.

    Acts 21:11 – Agabus prophesies about Paul’s future. Again, a Spirit-given word, but one that aligns with God’s already revealed plan.

The apostles encouraged the Spirit’s gifts:

    “Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good.”
    — 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21

So: yes, the early church believed the Spirit still spoke, but testing those revelations meant ensuring they did not contradict the teaching already handed down (“the faith once delivered to the saints,” Jude 3).
📜 2. Revelation Was Tested Against Apostolic Doctrine and Scripture

The early Fathers are consistent on this point:
Revelations or visions might be genuine, but they must be measured by the rule of faith (regula fidei).
🔹 Irenaeus (late 2nd century, Against Heresies, 3.1–4)

He says the apostles “delivered to us the Gospel” which the Church preserves “without additions or subtractions.”
He condemns those who claim new secret revelations apart from this deposit of faith.

    “We have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from those through whom the Gospel has come down to us… which they, at one time, proclaimed in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to us in the Scriptures.”
    — Against Heresies 3.1.1

That’s a clear statement:
New or personal revelations are not rejected, but they cannot alter or override what the apostles already taught and wrote.
🕯️ 3. They Did Not Teach “Obey Jesus Only If You Hear the Spirit”

No — that concept would have been alien to both the apostles and the early church.

The mainstream teaching was that Jesus’s commands are already authoritative and binding upon all believers, because they are the revelation of God in written and apostolic form.

    The early believers obeyed because they recognized Christ’s words as divine authority.

    The Spirit’s role was to help believers understand and obey what had already been revealed — not to determine whether it applied.

For example:

    “The Holy Spirit … recalls to your mind all that I have said to you.” — John 14:26
    (Notice: the Spirit brings to remembrance, not new or optional commandments.)

So, the Spirit illuminates Scripture, but does not make obedience conditional on receiving some new inner voice.
🏛️ 4. Early Fathers Reinforced This

A few quotes make this crystal clear:
🔹 Clement of Rome (c. 96 AD)

    “Let us look steadfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how precious that blood is to God, which, having been shed for our salvation, has set the grace of repentance before the whole world.”
    — 1 Clement 7
    He treats Christ’s words and example as binding — no waiting for a private revelation.

🔹 Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110 AD)

    “Do nothing apart from the bishop, and keep your flesh as a temple of God. Love unity, flee divisions; be imitators of Jesus Christ, even as He is of His Father.”
    — Letter to the Philadelphians 7
    Ignatius sees obedience to Christ’s teaching and the unity of the Church as the Spirit’s work — not something subjective or individualized.

🔹 Tertullian (before Montanism)

    “The rule of faith is indeed altogether one… that there is one only God, and no other besides the Maker of the world… who sent forth the Word… which Word is called His Son.”
    — Prescription Against Heretics 13
    He argued that this “rule of faith” is complete — all later revelations must agree with it.

✅ Summary

| Question | Early Church View |
| --- | --- |
| Did they believe in personal revelation? | Yes, the Spirit still speaks and guides. |
| Could that revelation contradict Scripture or apostolic teaching? | No, it must align with the “rule of faith.” |
| Did they teach obedience only if the Spirit personally tells you? | No, Jesus’s words and apostolic teaching were already binding. |
| What was the Spirit’s role? | To illuminate, guide, recall, and empower obedience to God’s revealed Word. |


So in short:
🕊️ The Spirit confirms and applies Scripture — He does not replace or qualify it.
The early Christians saw revelation and Scripture as united — not competing.

Would you like me to show how Montanism was the point where that balance started to drift — i.e., where “Spirit-led obedience” began to be treated as independent from apostolic command? That’s where the historical contrast becomes most vivid.
