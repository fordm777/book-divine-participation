What type of Christianity is this?   How does it compare to Ante-Nicene and scriptures

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s a clear summary and analysis of The Well Connection ministry from the website you shared — including what kind of Christianity it represents and how that compares with Ante-Nicene Christianity and Scripture.
📌 What The Well Connection Is

The Well Connection in Cumming, GA appears to be a Christian ministry/community that focuses on:

    Jesus Christ and relationship with Him — emphasizing that people can encounter Jesus, be known and loved, and grow spiritually through community and spiritual connection.

Creating a safe and supportive environment for people to connect, find hope, and experience healing.

Hosting events, prayer spaces, sessions, and community activities centered on fellowship and spiritual growth.

The language and focus are very relational and experiential — aiming to help people connect with Jesus and with each other in community.

The site itself does not publish a formal denomination alignment or a detailed theological statement of faith, which makes its exact category of Christianity less explicit than a traditional church.
🕊 What Type of Christianity This Represents

Based on the content on the site:

Core Orientation

    Christian / Christ-centered — Jesus is presented as central (Way, Truth, Life).

    Focus on relational faith and community rather than formal doctrine.

    Emphasis on hope, healing, and spiritual encounter with Jesus.

    Informal ministry environment (sessions, events, connection spaces).

This places The Well Connection within a modern, relational Christian ministry context — similar to:

✔ A para-church ministry (focused on Christian life, community, discipleship)
✔ Or a non-traditional Christian fellowship (not tied to a formal denominational creed)

This is common in many contemporary Christian groups that emphasize relationship with Jesus over detailed doctrinal teaching.

👉 The site itself does not affirm a specific historic creed (like Nicene or Apostles’ Creed) on its main pages, and it reads more like a ministry outreach site than a traditional church doctrinal statement.
📜 How It Compares with Ante-Nicene Christianity
📍 Ante-Nicene Christianity

    Refers to the Christian beliefs and practices before the Council of Nicaea (before 325 AD) — the period of the early Christian Church Fathers.

This era involved the beginnings of formal theology, early Christian worship patterns, and development of doctrine — including debates about Christ’s nature, the Trinity, salvation, etc.

While some core beliefs (faith in Jesus, Scripture, baptism) were present, doctrinal articulation was in early stages (e.g., Trinity not yet fully defined as in later creeds).

Comparison:

| Aspect | The Well Connection | Ante-Nicene Christianity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Central figure | Jesus Christ | Jesus Christ |
| Doctrine clarity | Informal, relational, not heavily creedal | Developing doctrine; not fully formalized |
| Creeds | Not explicitly stated on site | Before Nicene Creed formulation |
| Focus | Personal encounter, healing, community | Rooted in early Christian teaching and emerging theology |
| Scripture | Implied Christian authority but not doctrinally defined on website | Scriptures central, early writings referenced |


👉 In essence, The Well Connection shares the heart of Christian faith in Jesus, but it does not emphasize formal historic theology as thoroughly as early Ante-Nicene Christianity (which eventually led to codified creeds).
📖 How It Compares with Scripture

Common ground with Scripture

    Belief in Jesus as Savior and Lord.

    Emphasis on healing, community, and hope — themes found throughout the New Testament (e.g., fellowship in Acts, Jesus bringing healing and restoration).

Differences in practice or emphasis

    Scripture and historic Christian tradition often emphasize systematic theological beliefs (e.g., full Trinitarian doctrine, salvation doctrine) that ministries usually express through statements of faith or doctrinal documents.

    The Well Connection’s publicly visible presentation leans more experiential and relational, which is a valid Christian expression but less formal doctrinally explicit than classic scriptural theologizing.

🧾 Summary

The Well Connection appears to be:

✅ A Christian ministry community centered on Jesus and relational faith
✅ Focused on encounter, healing, community, and spiritual connection
❌ Not clearly aligned with a single historic denomination or formal creed (at least on the main site)

Compared with Ante-Nicene Christianity

    Shares Christian belief in Jesus but does not present historic theological formation that early Christians engaged in before the Nicene Council.

Compared with Scriptural Christianity

    Aligns broadly with New Testament themes but doesn’t articulate a detailed doctrinal statement publicly (e.g., on Scripture authority or creeds).

If you want, I can help compare its specific beliefs with a particular doctrinal standard (e.g., Nicene Creed, Apostle’s Creed, Southern Baptist, Reformed, etc.) — just let me know which tradition you’re interested in!

Divine Health Confessions December 31st 2025I’ve been imbued with the indestructible life of God. His nature in me makes me invincible and superhuman. Sickness and death have no place in my life. I refuse to be sickly because I've been ushered into the realm of abundant life.

**ChatGPT:**

Thank you for sharing the text. This is a very important diagnostic statement, because it clearly reveals a specific theological stream—and it’s not neutral.

I’ll break this down carefully and fairly, especially in light of Scripture and Ante-Nicene Christianity, which you’ve been consistently interested in.
1. What This Statement Is Theologically

    “I’ve been imbued with the indestructible life of God… invincible and superhuman… sickness and death have no place in my life… I refuse to be sickly…”

This language places the author squarely within what is commonly called:
Word-of-Faith / Divine Health / Prosperity-Healing Theology

Key markers:

    Positive confessions (“I’ve been imbued… I refuse…”)

    Present invincibility claims

    Denial of sickness and death as realities for believers

    Ontological elevation of the believer (“superhuman”)

This is not merely charismatic or Pentecostal.
It is a strong Word-of-Faith formulation.
2. Core Assumptions Behind the Statement

The theology assumes:

    Salvation regenerates the believer into a state of physical invulnerability

    Christ’s life is possessed in such a way that sickness is illegitimate

    Faith is exercised by verbal declaration

    Illness is implicitly a failure to live in revealed truth

These assumptions are not universally Christian—and they are absent from early Christianity.
3. Comparison with Scripture
❌ Where It Goes Beyond (or Against) Scripture
A. “Invincible and superhuman”

Scripture never describes Christians this way.

Paul explicitly rejects triumphalist anthropology:

    “We have this treasure in jars of clay”
    (2 Corinthians 4:7)

    “We who live are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake”
    (2 Corinthians 4:11)

The NT emphasizes weakness transfigured, not eliminated.
B. “Sickness and death have no place in my life”

This is theologically over-realized eschatology.

Scripture says:

    Death is defeated in principle, but destroyed at the resurrection (1 Cor 15:26)

    Believers still die

    Believers still suffer bodily weakness

Paul:

    Had a “thorn in the flesh” (2 Cor 12)

    Left Trophimus sick (2 Tim 4:20)

    Advised Timothy medicinal wine (1 Tim 5:23)

If divine life meant present invulnerability, these passages become incoherent.
C. “I refuse to be sickly”

Scripture never teaches refusal of illness as a faith act.

Instead:

    Christians pray for healing

    Endure suffering faithfully

    Trust God whether healed or not

    “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders…”
    (James 5)

Note: healing is petitioned, not declared as already ontologically guaranteed.
✅ What Is Scriptural (but Misapplied)

    Believers share in Christ’s life (John 15, Romans 6)

    Eternal life begins now (John 17:3)

    God heals and restores

The error is collapsing resurrection promises into present biological reality.
4. Comparison with Ante-Nicene Christianity

This is where the contrast becomes stark.
A. Early Christians Expected Suffering

Ante-Nicene Christians:

    Expected illness

    Expected martyrdom

    Expected bodily decay

    Did not expect bodily invincibility

Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110 AD):

    “Let me be food for the beasts… that I may attain to God.”

No talk of refusing death.
B. Divine Life ≠ Biological Immunity

Early theology:

    Participation in Christ = moral and ontological transformation

    Not elimination of bodily corruption before resurrection

Irenaeus:

    Salvation is recapitulation, not deification into invincibility

    Immortality is granted at resurrection, not possessed fully now

Athanasius later says Christ defeats death by entering it, not bypassing it.
C. Language of “Superhuman” Is Alien

Ante-Nicene writers:

    Emphasized humility

    Emphasized obedience

    Emphasized suffering with Christ

They never:

    Spoke of Christians as “superhuman”

    Claimed sickness had “no place” in the faithful

    Used self-directed confessions to shape reality

5. Theological Diagnosis (Plainly)

This statement reflects:

    ❌ Over-realized eschatology

    ❌ Misreading of union with Christ

    ❌ Confusion between resurrection life and present life

    ❌ Faith reduced to verbal assertion

    ❌ Implicit denial of the cross-shaped Christian life

It is not:

    Ante-Nicene

    Apostolic

    Consistent with the lived theology of Scripture

6. Why This Matters Pastorally

This theology:

    Places blame on the sick

    Creates shame when healing doesn’t occur

    Cannot account for faithful suffering

    Collapses when confronted with death

Ironically, it is less realistic and less incarnational than early Christianity.

Early Christians said:

    We will suffer—but death will not have the final word.

Word-of-Faith says:

    We should not suffer—and if we do, something is wrong.

Only one of these matches the New Testament.
7. Summary Judgment

This confession is not Christian heresy in the technical sense, but it is:

    Theologically imbalanced

    Historically unrooted

    Scripturally selective

    Spiritually dangerous if absolutized

It represents modern Word-of-Faith “Divine Health” Christianity, not the Christianity of:

    The apostles

    The martyrs

    The Ante-Nicene Church

If you want, next we can:

    Rewrite this confession into an Ante-Nicene-compatible form

    Compare it directly with baptismal theology (which you’ve rightly emphasized)

    Or trace how this theology emerged historically (Kenyon → Hagin → Copeland, etc.)

Just say the word.
