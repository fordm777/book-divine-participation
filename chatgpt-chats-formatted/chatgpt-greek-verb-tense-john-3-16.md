**User:**

In John 3:16 what is the greek verb tense of believeth?

**ChatGPT:**

In John 3:16, the Greek verb translated as "believeth" in the KJV is πιστεύων (pisteuōn), which is a present active participle in the nominative singular masculine form.
Explanation of the Verb Tense:

    Present tense: Indicates continuous or ongoing action rather than a one-time event.

    Active voice: The subject (the one believing) is performing the action.

    Participle: Functions like a verbal adjective, often meaning "the one who is believing" or "who continues to believe."

Theological Implication:

This suggests that faith in Christ is not just a one-time decision but an ongoing, continual trust in Him for eternal life.

In John 5:24 what tense is the verb heareth translated from in Greek

**ChatGPT:**

In John 5:24, the Greek verb translated as "heareth" in the KJV comes from ἀκούων (akouōn), which is a present active participle in the nominative singular masculine form.
Breakdown of the Verb Tense:

    Present tense: Indicates continuous or ongoing action rather than a one-time event.

    Active voice: The subject (the one hearing) is performing the action.

    Participle: Functions like a verbal adjective, meaning "the one who is hearing" or "who continues to hear."

Theological Implication:

Similar to pisteuōn ("believeth") in John 3:16, the use of the present participle for "heareth" suggests that hearing Jesus' words is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of listening and responding to His message.

**User:**

In the Greek language you mean that there are tenses that are not clear in modern English?   This is why the kjv translators used -eth on those words?

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, exactly. The Greek verb system has nuances that are not always clearly conveyed in modern English, particularly in how it expresses continuous or ongoing action. The -eth ending used in the KJV was an attempt to reflect these nuances, especially for verbs in the present active participle form in Greek.
Why the KJV Used "-eth":

In Early Modern English (the time of the KJV translation in 1611), the suffix "-eth" (e.g., believeth, heareth, loveth) was sometimes used to indicate a continuous or habitual action. This aligns with the Greek present tense, which often conveys an ongoing, repeated, or habitual action rather than a single moment in time.
Example:

    John 3:16 – "believeth" (πιστεύων, pisteuōn)

        Greek present active participle → "the one who is continually believing"

        KJV "believeth" → Suggests an ongoing, habitual faith

        Modern "believes" → Could sound more like a one-time event

    John 5:24 – "heareth" (ἀκούων, akouōn)

        Greek present active participle → "the one who is continually hearing"

        KJV "heareth" → Suggests an ongoing process of listening and responding

        Modern "hears" → Could imply just a single instance

Modern Translations:

Newer translations, like the ESV or NIV, usually translate these verbs with simple present tense (e.g., "believes" instead of "believeth"). While this is grammatically correct, it may lose the emphasis on continual action that the Greek text suggests.

So, the KJV's use of "-eth" was an effort to reflect this Greek nuance, even though English today no longer uses that grammatical form.

Summary of Paul’s Use of These Verbs

    Paul often used present participles and present tense verbs to describe continuous or repeated actions in the Christian life (e.g., believing, loving, sowing, reaping, perishing).

    The KJV translators tried to reflect this by using the "-eth" ending in Early Modern English, which implied an ongoing or habitual action.

    Modern translations typically just use the simple present tense (e.g., "believes" instead of "believeth"), but this sometimes loses the ongoing aspect of the Greek verbs.

It was my understanding that around 1611 time frame the use of thee thou ye thine and eth was not in common use.   I heard it was not in common use for over 100 years.   Any validity to this

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you’re onto something. By the time the KJV was translated (1604–1611), the use of thee, thou, ye, thine, and "-eth" endings was already declining in spoken English. However, these forms were still used in literary, poetic, and especially biblical/liturgical language.
Was "-eth" Archaic in 1611?

    By 1611, most people in everyday speech had already transitioned to "-s" endings for verbs (e.g., runs instead of runneth).

    "-eth" was still used in formal writing and scripture because it maintained a solemn, rhythmic, and traditional tone.

    In Shakespeare’s time (late 1500s – early 1600s), you see both "-eth" and "-s" forms in his plays, but "-s" was dominant in conversation.

What About "Thee" and "Thou"?

    By the late 1500s, "thou" and "thee" were disappearing from everyday English, especially in London and southern England.

    They survived longer in poetry, religious texts, and northern dialects.

    The KJV translators likely retained these forms because they preserved the distinction between singular ("thou") and plural/formal ("ye"), which modern English lacks.

Why Did the KJV Use Older Forms?

    Religious and Formal Tone – The translators aimed for a majestic, reverent style fitting for scripture.

    Linguistic Precision – "Thou" and "thee" helped distinguish singular vs. plural, which Greek and Hebrew have but modern English does not.

    Influence of Earlier Translations – The KJV built on earlier translations (Tyndale, Geneva Bible), which already used these forms.

Conclusion

    By 1611, these forms were not common in everyday speech but were still used in religious, poetic, and formal writing.

    The KJV translators deliberately used them to maintain the solemnity and precision of the text, not because they reflected everyday English at the time.

    Within about 100 years after the KJV (by the 1700s), these forms had largely vanished from all but liturgical and archaic-style English.

What about the word prayest vs prays?  See Matthew 6:6-7

**ChatGPT:**

In Matthew 6:6-7, the KJV uses "prayest" instead of "prays." This follows the same pattern as other Early Modern English verb forms that retain the "-est" ending for second-person singular verbs.
KJV (Matthew 6:6-7)

    6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
    7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

Greek Verb Tense in Matthew 6:6-7

    "Prayest" translates from the Greek verb προσεύχῃ (proseúchē), which is in the present middle/passive indicative, second-person singular.

    "Pray" in verse 7 (referring to a group) is προσεύχεσθε (proseúchesthe), which is in the present middle/passive imperative, second-person plural.

Why Does the KJV Say "Prayest"?

    Singular vs. Plural Distinction:

        "Thou prayest" (singular – directed at an individual).

        "Ye pray" (plural – directed at a group).

        Modern English loses this distinction, but it was clear in Greek and Elizabethan English.

    "-est" Ending for Second-Person Singular:

        In Early Modern English (Shakespearean/KJV English), verbs ending in "-est" were used for "thou" (singular "you").

        Example: Thou goest, thou speakest, thou prayest.

    The Shift to Modern English:

        By 1611, "-est" forms were disappearing from spoken English but were still used in literary and biblical texts for formality and precision.

        Today, we just say "you pray" for both singular and plural.

Comparison with Modern Translations

    ESV: But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door...

    NIV: But when you pray, go into your room...

    NASB: But as for you, when you pray, go into your inner room...

Modern translations drop "thou" and "-est" endings and simply say "you pray", which removes the singular/plural distinction present in the Greek.
Conclusion

    "Prayest" was used because it reflected the original Greek singular form and fit the formal, biblical tone of the KJV.

    "Ye pray" was used in verse 7 to address multiple people, preserving the Greek plural form.

    By 1611, "prayest" was no longer common in everyday speech, but the KJV translators retained it for accuracy and reverence.
