# Formatted ChatGPT Conversations

This directory contains reformatted versions of ChatGPT conversations used for research and development of the book.

## Format

Each file has been converted from the raw ChatGPT export format into clean Markdown with:

- **Title** - Derived from the filename (e.g., "Greek Word Kainos")
- **Source reference** - Original filename for tracking
- **Clean conversation flow** - User and ChatGPT exchanges clearly marked
- **Removed boilerplate** - Headers, footers, and disclaimers removed
- **Preserved content** - All substantive content maintained

## Structure

Each formatted file follows this pattern:

```markdown
# Title

*Source: original-filename.txt*

---

**User:**

[User's question or comment]

**ChatGPT:**

[ChatGPT's response]

[Additional exchanges...]
```

## Files

- Ante-Nicene Fathers discussions
- Greek word studies (kainos, verb tenses, etc.)
- Biblical exegesis (Romans, Corinthians, John, etc.)
- Theological topics (atonement, covenant, baptism, etc.)

## Usage
