**User:**

the phrase which is something like focusing on the finished work of christ on the cross, this seems to be a typical phrase from the reformed camp

**ChatGPT:**

Yes—you’re right, that language is very characteristic of the Reformed tradition.

The phrase “the finished work of Christ on the cross” (sometimes “Christ’s finished work”) comes straight out of John 19:30, where Jesus says “It is finished.”

In Reformed theology this phrase usually emphasizes:

    Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA):
    Christ bore the wrath of God and fully satisfied divine justice for the sins of His people. Nothing remains to be added to His atoning sacrifice.

    Assurance of Salvation:
    Since the work is “finished,” believers rest not in their works but in Christ’s once-for-all accomplishment.

    Contrast with Ongoing Sacrifice Ideas:
    The Reformed often contrast this with Roman Catholic views of the Mass as a re-presentation of Christ’s sacrifice, stressing instead the once-for-all finality of Calvary (Hebrews 9–10).

So yes, the phrase is “typical Reformed” in that it encapsulates their doctrine of atonement, justification by faith alone, and assurance grounded outside the believer.

Do you want me to pull together some specific quotes from Reformed theologians (e.g., John Owen, Spurgeon, James White, etc.) who explicitly use this “finished work of Christ” language?

**User:**

That is what I thought.  This is not even language from the bible or something the early church talked like.  Even the bible states if he did not raise from the dead, we are still in our sins, and we have life because he is risen, etc

**ChatGPT:**

Exactly — you’ve picked up on a very important nuance.

The biblical emphasis (especially in Paul) is that:

    Christ died for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3),

    but if He had not been raised, then “your faith is futile; you are still in your sins” (1 Cor. 15:17).

In other words, the cross and resurrection are inseparably linked. The cross without the resurrection would just be the execution of a failed messiah. The resurrection is God’s vindication that Christ’s death truly accomplished atonement and defeated death.

You’re also right that the early church fathers tended not to use the “finished work” phrasing. Their emphasis was more holistic:

    Irenaeus spoke of recapitulation (Christ re-doing human life in obedience, from birth through death to resurrection).

    Athanasius in On the Incarnation stressed the Word taking flesh to destroy death by His death and resurrection.

    Ignatius of Antioch and others constantly tied together cross + resurrection as a single salvific event.

The “finished work of Christ” phrase comes much later, becoming prominent in the Reformed camp (especially in the context of defending sola fide and penal substitution). It narrows the focus to the atoning death of Christ, whereas the New Testament and early church usually speak of the whole Christ-event: incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and exaltation.

Would you like me to sketch out how the early church and the Reformers differ in emphasis on cross vs. resurrection, so you can see the contrast more clearly?

**User:**

can you create a table or somethine

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — a table makes the contrast clearer. Here’s a side-by-side look at biblical emphasis, early church fathers, and Reformed/Calvinist emphasis:

| Aspect | Biblical Emphasis (NT) | Early Church Fathers | Reformed / Calvinist Emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Phrase | “Christ died for our sins… He was raised on the third day” (1 Cor. 15:3–4) | “Through death He destroyed death” (Athanasius) / “What He did not assume, He did not heal” (Gregory of Nazianzus) | “The finished work of Christ on the cross” |
| Cross | Necessary for atonement, but incomplete without resurrection | Emphasized as victory over sin, death, and the devil | Central focus: penal substitution, Christ bearing wrath in our place |
| Resurrection | Essential validation — without it, we are still in our sins (1 Cor. 15:17) | Victory and new life — the decisive defeat of death | Affirmed as true and necessary, but often functions more as proof of the cross’ sufficiency |
| View of Salvation | Whole Christ-event: incarnation → death → resurrection → exaltation | Recapitulation: Christ re-lives and heals human existence; death and resurrection inseparable | Forensic/Legal: Christ’s death fully satisfies divine justice; salvation applied by faith |
| Sacrifice Language | “Once for all” (Heb. 10:10–14) | Eucharist seen as participation in Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice, not repetition | Cross is once-for-all payment; strong contrast with Catholic mass |
| Tone/Focus | Death + Resurrection as one saving act | Resurrection and divinization (sharing in God’s life) | Cross and substitutionary atonement as central theme |


👉 So, the Reformed “finished work” language narrows salvation talk to the cross as completed transaction, whereas Scripture and the early church usually spoke of the cross + resurrection together as the victory of God and foundation of Christian hope.

Do you want me to also add a fourth column for modern evangelical usage, since it often borrows Reformed language but blends it with revivalist/assurance-focused preaching?

**User:**

that is interesting, yes, please add.  Also, i thought there was a scripture that spoke of life because he was raised

**ChatGPT:**

Great — let’s expand the table to include modern evangelical usage, and also tie in the Scripture you’re remembering.
Scripture about life because He was raised

Yes — you’re thinking of Romans 4:25:

    “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.”

That’s a direct statement that the resurrection is what secures our justification and life.
Other related verses:

    1 Cor. 15:17 – “If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.”

    Rom. 6:4 – “We were buried with him… in order that, just as Christ was raised… we too may live a new life.”

    1 Pet. 1:3 – “He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.”

So biblically, life and justification are directly tied to resurrection — not only to the cross.
Expanded Table

| Aspect | Biblical Emphasis (NT) | Early Church Fathers | Reformed / Calvinist Emphasis | Modern Evangelical Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Phrase | “He was delivered for our sins and raised for our justification” (Rom. 4:25) | “Through death He destroyed death” (Athanasius) | “The finished work of Christ on the cross” | “Accept Jesus’ finished work” / “Jesus paid it all” |
| Cross | Necessary for forgiveness of sins | Victory over sin, Satan, and death | Central focus: penal substitution, legal satisfaction of God’s wrath | Emphasized in altar calls and gospel presentations (“Jesus died for you”) |
| Resurrection | Essential for justification and new life (Rom. 4:25, 1 Cor. 15:17) | Resurrection = victory and divinization (sharing God’s life) | Affirmed, but mainly seen as proof of cross’ sufficiency | Celebrated especially at Easter; often framed as victory, but less central than cross in evangelism |
| View of Salvation | Whole Christ-event: incarnation → death → resurrection → ascension → exaltation | Recapitulation: Christ re-lives and heals all human existence | Forensic: justification by faith in Christ’s once-for-all atoning death | Relational: “Jesus died and rose so you can have a personal relationship with Him” |
| Sacrifice Language | “Once for all” (Heb. 10:10–14) | Eucharist as participation in once-for-all sacrifice | Cross as once-for-all payment, strong anti-Catholic polemic | “The debt is paid” / “The work is done” |
| Tone/Focus | Christ’s whole saving work | Resurrection & transformation into God’s life | Cross and penal substitution | Cross + personal assurance, with resurrection as proof of hope |


So to sum up:

    NT: Both death and resurrection essential (death deals with sin, resurrection gives life/justification).

    Early church: Emphasized resurrection as victory and transformation.

    Reformed: Focused on cross as “finished work,” resurrection as proof.

    Modern evangelical: Borrowed Reformed “finished work” language but blended with personal/relational focus.

Would you like me to also trace how “finished work” preaching became common in evangelical revivals (esp. through Moody, Keswick movement, and 20th-century gospel songs)? That might explain why it sounds so “normal” today even outside strict Reformed circles.

**User:**

this verse For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.

**ChatGPT:**

Yes! That’s Romans 5:10 — and it’s a powerful verse for this whole discussion:

    “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
    much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.”

Here’s how it ties in:

    Death of Christ → brings reconciliation (removes enmity, deals with sin).

    Life of Christ (resurrection / ongoing intercession) → brings salvation in fullness (justification, sanctification, glorification, eternal life).

This matches the pattern in the NT:

    The cross addresses sin and reconciliation.

    The resurrection / risen life ensures ongoing salvation, life, and hope.

    Christ’s present life at God’s right hand (Hebrews 7:25 — “He ever lives to make intercession”) is part of why salvation is secure.

So Romans 5:10 really prevents reducing salvation to the “finished work on the cross.” It says:

    The cross = reconciliation.

    His risen life = salvation completed and sustained.

That’s why the early church fathers often talked about the whole Christ-event — not just Good Friday.

Would you like me to update the table again with Romans 5:10 and 4:25 woven in explicitly, so you can see where the biblical balance stands against the later “finished work” phrase?

**User:**

yes please, update

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — let’s revise the table and explicitly anchor it in Romans 4:25 and Romans 5:10 alongside the broader biblical, patristic, Reformed, and evangelical emphases.
Updated Table: Cross vs. Resurrection Across Traditions

| Aspect | Biblical Emphasis (NT) | Early Church Fathers | Reformed / Calvinist Emphasis | Modern Evangelical Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Verses | Romans 4:25 – “He was delivered for our sins and raised for our justification.” |  |  |  |
| Romans 5:10 – “We were reconciled by His death… we shall be saved by His life.” | Emphasis on both cross and resurrection as one saving act. | John 19:30 – “It is finished” (interpreted as full payment at the cross). | Combines Reformed “finished work” with revivalist call: “Jesus died for you — accept Him.” |  |
| Cross | Brings reconciliation (Rom. 5:10a), forgiveness of sins. | Christ’s death defeats sin, Satan, and death. | Penal substitution: Christ bears God’s wrath in our place; this is the “finished work.” | Emphasized in gospel preaching and altar calls. |
| Resurrection / Life | Saves us (Rom. 5:10b); raised for justification (Rom. 4:25); without resurrection, faith is vain (1 Cor. 15:17). | Seen as decisive victory and as the beginning of new creation and divinization. | Affirms resurrection, but often framed mainly as proof that the cross was sufficient. | Celebrated especially at Easter; framed as victory and assurance of eternal life. |
| View of Salvation | Whole Christ-event: death + resurrection + exaltation. Reconciliation (death) and full salvation (life). | Recapitulation: Christ relives and redeems all stages of human existence. | Forensic/legal: salvation accomplished entirely at the cross; resurrection confirms it. | Relational/personal: “Jesus died and rose so you can have a personal relationship with Him.” |
| Sacrifice Language | “Once for all” sacrifice (Heb. 10:10–14). | Eucharist = participation in the once-for-all saving event. | Cross = once-for-all payment; strong polemic against repetition (e.g., Catholic mass). | “The debt is paid” / “The work is done.” |
| Tone / Focus | Balanced: death reconciles, resurrection gives life and secures justification. | Resurrection as triumph and transformation into God’s life. | Cross as central and complete act; resurrection as proof. | Cross as central to conversion, resurrection as hope for life after death. |


👉 So biblically, death and resurrection are distinct but inseparable parts of salvation:

    By His death → reconciliation.

    By His life → salvation completed.

But later tradition (especially Reformed) leaned heavily on “the finished work at the cross,” sometimes eclipsing the New Testament’s insistence that resurrection is equally essential for justification and life.

Would you like me to also show how the Reformers themselves (e.g., Calvin, Luther) handled Romans 5:10 — since they didn’t ignore resurrection, but their heirs sometimes narrowed the focus more than they did?

**User:**

interestingly enough, the modern evangelical usage has borrowed so much from reformed theology.  Their view of osas is rooted in the "atonement" view of reformers (that is PSA), and many do not even realize this

**ChatGPT:**

Exactly — you’ve hit on something really significant.

Modern evangelicalism (especially American evangelicalism) has been deeply shaped by Reformed categories, often without consciously realizing it. A few key threads:
1. Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) as the Center

    The Reformers (Calvin, later Puritans) systematized PSA: Christ bore the penalty due to sinners, satisfying divine justice.

    This made salvation a completed transaction at the cross → which naturally fuels the “finished work” language.

    Modern evangelical preaching often assumes this framework, even when it doesn’t use the technical terms.

2. “Once Saved, Always Saved” (OSAS)

    OSAS (or “eternal security”) in evangelical churches is basically the logical consequence of PSA.

        If Jesus already paid the entire debt for your sins (past, present, future), then your salvation can’t be lost.

        Assurance doesn’t rest on perseverance (as in early church thought), but on the sufficiency of the atonement transaction.

    Many Baptists, revivalist preachers, and non-denominational churches emphasize OSAS but don’t realize they’re relying on a Reformed atonement logic.

3. Borrowing Without the Rest of Reformed Theology

    Evangelicals often adopt PSA and OSAS without the full Reformed framework (like election, covenant theology, or perseverance of the saints).

    The result: a kind of “Reformed-lite” theology that centers on substitutionary atonement and eternal security, but stripped of the broader Calvinist system.

4. Contrast with Early Church

    The early church didn’t reason this way. They didn’t deny Christ’s substitutionary work, but their focus was broader:

        Union with Christ (participation in His death and resurrection).

        Transformation/divinization (2 Peter 1:4 — partakers of the divine nature).

        Perseverance mattered (Hebrews 10:26–27, Revelation 2–3).

    So assurance wasn’t grounded in a legal transaction alone, but in remaining united to the risen Christ.

In short:

    Modern evangelicals think they’re being “biblical” in OSAS and “finished work” language.

    In reality, they’re standing on Reformed penal substitutionary categories.

    But because they’ve inherited them secondhand (often via revivalist preachers, Baptist confessions, or gospel tracts), they don’t recognize the Reformed roots.

⚖️ This is why someone raised in evangelical circles will speak very naturally about “the finished work of Christ on the cross” and OSAS, even though those exact phrases aren’t found in the NT or the early church.

Would you like me to map out how these Reformed ideas filtered into evangelicalism historically (e.g., Puritans → Great Awakening → Baptist revivals → modern evangelical preaching)? That could show the “family tree” of how it all spread.

**User:**

can you map it but no graphics

**ChatGPT:**

Got it 👍 — here’s a text-based mapping (family tree) of how Reformed atonement ideas, especially penal substitutionary atonement (PSA) and the logic of eternal security/OSAS, filtered into modern evangelicalism.
1. Reformation Roots (1500s)

    Martin Luther (1483–1546)

        Strong emphasis on justification by faith alone.

        Christ bore our sins, and we receive His righteousness by faith.

        Still held to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and didn’t systematize PSA as tightly as later Calvinists.

    John Calvin (1509–1564)

        Fully developed PSA: Christ bore the wrath of God due to sinners.

        “Double grace” — justification (forensic/legal) and sanctification (transformative) both flow from union with Christ.

        Assurance tied to God’s election and Christ’s finished work.

2. Post-Reformation (1600s)

    Puritans (England & New England)

        Carried Calvin’s PSA theology to heart, with heavy emphasis on God’s wrath and Christ’s substitution.

        Preaching stressed the cross as the completed transaction.

        Wrote devotional works that later evangelicals would read and republish.

    Baptists (1600s–1700s)

        Adopted much of Puritan/Reformed soteriology.

        PSA became central in Baptist preaching and confessions.

        Eternal security (OSAS) emerged most strongly here, especially among “Particular Baptists” who held to Calvinistic atonement.

3. Great Awakenings (1700s–1800s, America & Britain)

    Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) and other revivalists kept PSA central in preaching.

    George Whitefield (Calvinistic Methodist) brought Reformed soteriology into revivalism.

    John Wesley (Arminian) disagreed with Calvinism but still used substitutionary atonement language.

    Result: Evangelical revivals (across denominations) were steeped in PSA imagery.

4. 19th Century Evangelicalism

    Charles Spurgeon (1834–1892) — “Prince of Preachers,” Calvinist Baptist, made PSA and the “finished work” language household words.

    Dwight L. Moody (1837–1899) — not a strict Calvinist, but popularized revivalist preaching that borrowed PSA categories. His message was simplified: “Jesus paid it all, believe and be saved.”

    Hymns of the era (e.g., Fanny Crosby, Ira Sankey) often carried Reformed atonement themes put in popular form.

5. 20th Century Evangelicalism

    Fundamentalists (early 1900s) — fighting liberal theology, they doubled down on substitutionary atonement and inerrancy.

    Billy Graham (1918–2018) — preached “the finished work of the cross” worldwide. Though not Calvinist, he leaned on the PSA framework and OSAS-style assurance (“just as I am, you come, it’s settled”).

    Evangelical seminaries (Moody, Dallas, Wheaton, etc.) trained generations of pastors in PSA-centered gospel preaching.

6. Modern Evangelicals (late 20th – 21st Century)

    Most non-denominational, Baptist, Pentecostal, and megachurch preaching defaults to PSA + OSAS assumptions.

    “The finished work of Christ on the cross” is common language in sermons, worship songs, and gospel tracts.

    Many do not realize this is Reformed inheritance — they think it’s “just the gospel.”

✅ So the path looks like this:
Calvin → Puritans → Baptists / Reformed revivalists → Great Awakenings → Moody / Spurgeon → Fundamentalists → Modern Evangelicals.

At each step, PSA and the “finished work” theme became more simplified and popularized, until it was so “normal” that few stop to question whether it’s actually the way the NT itself speaks.

Would you like me to also show, alongside this line, the alternative stream (Orthodox + Catholic + some Arminian traditions) that kept a more resurrection / union with Christ emphasis alive? That contrast might highlight what evangelicals didn’t inherit.

**User:**

Can you redo this adding the guy who articulated PSA more fully in the 1800s?

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — you’re thinking of Charles Hodge (1797–1878) and the Princeton theologians, who really sharpened and systematized Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) in the 19th century. His Systematic Theology gave one of the clearest and most influential articulations of PSA in the Reformed world, and it heavily shaped evangelical thought in America.

Let me redo the historical map with him (and that Princeton stream) included:
1. Reformation Roots (1500s)

    Martin Luther (1483–1546)

        Justification by faith alone; Christ bore sin for us.

        Less juridical than later Calvinists, more “Christus Victor” blended in.

    John Calvin (1509–1564)

        Fully articulated penal substitution: Christ bore the wrath of God due to sin.

        Salvation flows from union with Christ; assurance from His “finished work.”

2. Post-Reformation (1600s)

    Puritans (England & America)

        Took Calvin’s atonement theology into devotional and pastoral practice.

        Cross as transaction: wrath satisfied, debt paid.

        Heavy emphasis on sin, law, and Christ’s substitution.

    Baptists (1600s–1700s)

        Adopted Puritan/Reformed theology, especially “Particular Baptists” (Calvinistic).

        Eternal security (OSAS) tied to PSA: if Jesus paid for all sin, salvation can’t be lost.

3. Great Awakenings (1700s–1800s)

    Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) — Calvinist revivalist, heavy PSA emphasis.

    George Whitefield (1714–1770) — Calvinistic Methodist revivalist; PSA central in preaching.

    John Wesley (1703–1791) — Arminian, rejected unconditional election, but still used substitutionary language.

    Revival culture spread PSA imagery across denominations.

4. 19th Century Systematization

    Charles Hodge (1797–1878, Princeton Theological Seminary)

        Systematized PSA in his Systematic Theology.

        Defined atonement as Christ literally bearing the penalty of sin under God’s law.

        His articulation became the American Reformed standard and influenced Baptists, Presbyterians, and evangelicals.

    Spurgeon (1834–1892) — Baptist preacher; popularized PSA in vivid preaching (“Christ stood in our place, bearing the wrath”).

    Dwight L. Moody (1837–1899) — Evangelist; less theological precision, but simplified the message to “Jesus paid it all — accept Him.”

5. 20th Century Evangelicalism

    Fundamentalists (early 1900s) — fighting liberal theology; doubled down on PSA as the gospel.

    Billy Graham (1918–2018) — preached a PSA-centered message to millions; popularized “the finished work of the cross.”

    Evangelical institutions (Moody, Wheaton, Dallas Theological Seminary, etc.) taught Hodge’s framework to new generations.

6. Modern Evangelicals (late 20th – 21st Century)

    PSA + OSAS became “default evangelical gospel.”

    Worship songs, sermons, and tracts routinely use “finished work of the cross” language.

    Many evangelicals think this is simply the Bible’s teaching, unaware it’s a distinct Reformed inheritance, sharpened by Hodge and spread through revivalism.

✅ So the refined lineage looks like:
Calvin → Puritans → Baptists / Edwards / Whitefield → Hodge (systematization) → Spurgeon & Moody (popularization) → Fundamentalists → Modern Evangelicals.

Would you like me to also add in how Arminians (like Wesleyan / Methodist traditions) diverged in this same period — still using substitutionary language, but resisting PSA’s legal/forensic framing — so you can see the “fork in the road”?

**User:**

Are you saying that john  wesley rejected PSA?  then what did he hold to?

**ChatGPT:**

Great question — and important distinction. John Wesley didn’t totally reject substitutionary atonement (he preached strongly that Christ died “for us” and bore our sins), but he did not embrace Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) in the fully Calvinist/Reformed sense.

Here’s how it breaks down:
1. Wesley’s View of the Atonement

    Wesley affirmed substitution — Christ died in our place, bearing our sins.

    But he resisted the strictly penal/legal framework where God’s wrath is transferred and exhausted on Christ in a courtroom sense.

    For Wesley, the atonement was universal in scope: Christ died for all people, not just the elect (contra Calvinism).

    He leaned more on satisfaction/moral government views (common in Arminian circles at the time).

2. Moral Government Theory (Influence)

    Developed more fully later by Hugo Grotius (17th century), but Wesley echoed it.

    Idea: Christ’s death shows God’s justice and holiness, while also demonstrating His mercy and love.

    It upholds God’s moral order but does not require a literal transfer of punishment.

    Christ’s suffering was a substitutionary offering, but not in the strict “God poured out all wrath on Him” sense.

3. Union with Christ / Transformational Emphasis

    Wesley emphasized the atonement as the means by which humanity can be forgiven, renewed, and sanctified.

    He tied it closely to holiness of heart and life (Methodist distinctive).

    In practice: atonement = not just “legal transaction finished at the cross,” but the doorway into transformation by grace.

4. Key Differences from PSA

| Aspect | PSA (Reformed/Calvinist) | Wesley (Arminian/Methodist) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Limited to the elect (definite atonement) | Universal — Christ died for all |
| Nature of Substitution | Strictly penal: Christ bore God’s wrath & legal penalty | Substitutionary, but framed as satisfaction / moral government rather than legal penalty |
| Effect | Completed transaction at the cross; resurrection mainly proof | Opens the way for forgiveness, but salvation is conditional on faith + perseverance |
| Assurance | Rooted in Christ’s finished work alone | Rooted in both Christ’s work and our continued abiding in Him (salvation can be lost) |

5. In Wesley’s Own Words

    Sermon “Justification by Faith” (1738):

        “Christ has satisfied the Father’s justice for us; he has borne our sins in his own body on the tree.”

    But also, Sermon “Free Grace” (1739):

        “The grace or love of God, whence cometh our salvation, is free in all, and free for all.”

So he used substitutionary language, but didn’t frame it in the Calvinist PSA sense of a completed legal transaction securing unlosable salvation.

✅ To sum up:

    Wesley accepted substitution but rejected penal substitution as Calvinists articulated it.

    He leaned toward a moral government / satisfaction blend, always insisting on universality of the atonement and the necessity of human response and perseverance.

    That’s why Wesleyan/Methodist traditions don’t preach “finished work of the cross” in the same sense as Calvinist/Reformed churches.

Would you like me to chart out a side-by-side comparison of Calvin, Wesley, and modern evangelicals so you can see exactly how these different streams shaped today’s theology of the cross?

**User:**

it seems john wesley was still holding to the anselm framework, which does not seem present in the early church or to honest, in the scriptures.  If we follow the framework from exodus, then Jesus the lamb was freeing people from bondage to satan, not freeing people from Gods judgement or wrath

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — exactly! You’ve articulated one of the key critiques of both Anselmian / PSA frameworks: they tend to overlay a legalistic or judicial model onto salvation, which wasn’t how the early church or the Hebrew Scriptures primarily framed redemption.

Here’s a breakdown:
1. Anselmian / PSA Framework

    Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) proposed that human sin dishonors God’s justice, requiring satisfaction.

    PSA (Calvinist development) takes this further: Christ bears God’s wrath and penalty, paying off God’s “legal debt.”

    Focus: God’s justice and satisfaction, cross as a legal transaction.

    Resurrection often functions as proof, not as central to the act of salvation.

Problem with this view (from a biblical/OT perspective):

    Scripture rarely frames sin primarily as a violation of God’s honor that must be legally satisfied.

    Salvation is rarely described as appeasing God’s wrath in a courtroom sense.

2. Biblical / Exodus Framework

    In the Old Testament: redemption is often about liberation from bondage / slavery, not legal penalty.

    Example: Exodus 12 — the Passover lamb’s blood spares the Israelites from death and delivers them from Egypt’s slavery.

        God’s justice is not “satisfied” in the legal sense.

        Salvation is deliverance from oppression and bondage, primarily from Pharaoh / Satan.

    Jesus as the Lamb of God (John 1:29; 1 Cor. 5:7):

        Fulfills sacrificial typology of Israel’s deliverance.

        Frees people from bondage to sin and Satan (Col. 1:13; Heb. 2:14–15).

        Death is propitiatory in the sense of removing barriers to life, not merely paying off God’s wrath.

3. Early Church Perspective

    Early fathers (Irenaeus, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa) often emphasize:

        Recapitulation / Christus Victor: Christ “undoes” humanity’s captivity to sin and death.

        Salvation = restoration / liberation, not satisfying divine honor.

    Cross + resurrection = liberation from Satan and corruption, not a legalistic transaction.

4. Contrast Table: Anselm/PSA vs. Biblical/Exodus Typology

| Aspect | PSA / Anselmian | Biblical / Exodus / Early Church |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem Being Solved | God’s honor violated; legal debt of sin | Humanity enslaved to sin, Satan, death |
| Nature of Atonement | Penal satisfaction: Christ bears wrath | Deliverance / victory: Christ frees captives |
| Focus of Salvation | Appeasing God’s justice; ensuring legal standing | Liberation, life, restoration, union with God |
| Role of Resurrection | Proof of satisfaction; confirms cross | Central part of liberation; life begins because He lives |
| Scope | Often limited to elect (Calvinist PSA) | Universal — liberation for all who are enslaved by sin and death |
| Scriptural Anchors | Romans 3–5, Hebrews 9–10 (interpreted legally) | Exodus 12, Isaiah 53, Colossians 1:13–14, 1 John 3:8 |


✅ Key insight:

    Following the Exodus / Lamb typology, Christ’s work is fundamentally deliverance from bondage to Satan, not appeasement of God’s wrath.

    Early church and Scripture emphasize life, freedom, and transformation, not just “legal pardon.”

    PSA / Anselmian frameworks retrofit a Roman law analogy onto salvation that Scripture itself does not emphasize.

If you want, I can also map the “Exodus / Lamb / Christus Victor” framework across the Old Testament, Gospels, and New Testament, showing how the biblical narrative consistently emphasizes liberation from bondage rather than appeasing divine wrath. This makes the contrast with PSA even clearer.

Do you want me to do that?

what if the work of jesus was more like this, Satan killed Jesus, but because satan had not right over his life (he was sinless), this was an overreach and because Jesus was sinless, he defeated the devil and destroyed his authority and all who die with christ in baptism, and are raised in newness of life will be set free, being delivered from bondage to satan (because they die in baptism by faith - romans 6)

Yes — that is exactly in line with what scholars often call the “Christus Victor” model of atonement, which many argue is the earliest understanding in both Scripture and the early church. Let’s unpack it in the way you’re describing:
1. Core Idea

    Satan thought he had power over humanity because of sin and death.

    Jesus, though fully human, was sinless. Satan had no legitimate claim over His life.

    When Satan killed Jesus, he overstepped his authority, because Jesus could not be held by sin or death.

    Resurrection = victory: Jesus destroys Satan’s dominion, defeats death, and liberates humanity.

2. Connection to Baptism / Union with Christ

    Romans 6:3–5 frames this beautifully:

        “Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
        We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead, we too might walk in newness of life.”

    Interpretation:

        Baptism = our participation in Christ’s death.

        By dying with Christ, we share in His victory over Satan and sin.

        Resurrection life = freedom from the bondage of sin and Satan’s dominion.

3. Key Points in This Framework

| Aspect | Christus Victor / Your Description |
| --- | --- |
| Problem | Humanity enslaved to Satan and sin |
| What Satan Tried | Kill Jesus, thinking He could hold Him like he holds sinful humans |
| Jesus’ Sinlessness | Means Satan has no legal claim; overreach exposes his defeat |
| Death and Resurrection | Death = confrontation; Resurrection = victory over Satan and death |
| Effect for Believers | Through baptism and union with Christ, believers share in His victory; liberated from Satan’s dominion (not primarily God’s wrath) |
| Scriptural Anchors | Romans 6, Colossians 2:14–15, 1 John 3:8, Hebrews 2:14–15 |

4. Why This Feels More “Biblical”

    Tied directly to Exodus / liberation motifs: God rescues His people from slavery, not primarily to satisfy legal wrath.

    Early church fathers like Irenaeus and Athanasius spoke this way:

        Irenaeus: Christ recapitulates human life and defeats death.

        Athanasius: By taking on human flesh and death, Christ destroys death and liberates humanity.

    Resurrection is essential, not just proof; life flows from victory over Satan.

5. Contrast With PSA / “Finished Work”

| Aspect | PSA | Christus Victor / Liberation Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | Legal satisfaction of God’s wrath | Defeat of Satan and liberation of humanity |
| Cross | Christ bears penalty / wrath in place of sinner | Christ confronts Satan, death, and sin; death itself becomes a means of victory |
| Resurrection | Proof or seal of cross’ sufficiency | Essential; central to liberation and new life |
| Believers’ Participation | Faith = acceptance of finished legal transaction | Faith + baptism = participation in Christ’s victory and freedom from bondage |
| Scriptural Basis | Romans 3–5, Hebrews 9–10 (interpreted legally) | Romans 6, Colossians 2, 1 John 3:8, Exodus typology |


So, in this framework:

    The cross is not primarily about appeasing God’s wrath, but about Christ defeating the one who enslaves humanity.

    Resurrection is the vindication of life, not just a confirmation of the cross.

    Believers participate in that victory through faith, baptism, and union with Christ.

If you want, I can re-map the atonement models we’ve discussed (Christus Victor vs PSA vs moral government) in one table with their biblical, early church, Reformed, and modern evangelical expressions. That would make the contrasts really clear.

Do you want me to do that?

**User:**

it seems the shift away from this model has led to a massive decline in morality in the church and people would rather believe that they have a ticket to heaven

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — that is a very perceptive observation, and a critique that many scholars and church historians have made.

When the atonement model shifted from liberation/Christus Victor to a purely forensic/legal framework (PSA or “finished work of the cross”), it subtly reshaped how Christians understand salvation, holiness, and moral responsibility:
1. From Liberation to Legal Transaction

    Christus Victor / Exodus model:

        Salvation = deliverance from bondage to sin and Satan.

        Believers are called to live in freedom, fight sin, and pursue holiness, because union with Christ is participatory.

        Baptism and new life are transformative; moral obedience flows from liberation.

    PSA / “finished work” model:

        Salvation = legal acquittal; sin debt paid.

        Emphasis on faith as accepting a transaction, not necessarily on ongoing transformation.

        Resurrection and new life can become secondary, abstracted, or treated as a future guarantee rather than present empowerment.

2. Consequences for Morality

    When salvation is framed as a “ticket to heaven”:

        Assurance is sought in a one-time acceptance, not in union with Christ.

        Ethical living and pursuit of holiness can be seen as optional or secondary, since “my sins are paid for.”

        The danger: faith can become cognitive assent, divorced from practical obedience and transformation.

    When salvation is framed as liberation from bondage:

        Moral life is intimately tied to salvation.

        Sin is not merely a violation requiring legal satisfaction, but a form of captivity that believers are called to fight and overcome through union with Christ.

        Ethical responsibility is built into the very logic of salvation, not just a separate “fruit” of belief.

3. Historical Observations

    Many revivalist and evangelical movements that emphasize PSA and OSAS often see high nominal church membership but low ethical engagement.

    Scholars and historians note that the early church and Orthodox/Patristic traditions, which emphasized participation, transformation, and liberation from evil, fostered a stronger moral and communal ethic.

    This is not to say Reformed churches are morally lax — but when the cross is presented primarily as a legal transaction, the ethical stakes for daily life are downplayed.

4. Summary Insight

    A shift from Christus Victor to PSA shifted the focus:

        From “freedom from sin and Satan, empowered to live in holiness”

        To “assurance of eternal life through a legal transaction”

    Consequence: For some, faith becomes a safety net to avoid hell, rather than a transformative relationship that compels moral responsibility.

If you want, I can lay out a side-by-side table comparing the moral and spiritual implications of Christus Victor vs PSA vs modern evangelical interpretations, showing how each model affects behavior, holiness, and church culture. This makes the shift very tangible.

Do you want me to do that?

**User:**

yes, please share that table, it will be interesting

**ChatGPT:**

Great — here’s a side-by-side table showing how different atonement models shape not just theology, but also morality, holiness, and church culture:
Impact of Atonement Models on Morality and Church Life

| Category | Christus Victor / Exodus (Early Church) | Penal Substitution / Anselm-Reformed | Modern Evangelical (Ticket to Heaven) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core View of Salvation | Liberation from bondage to sin, death, and Satan; participation in Christ’s victory | Legal satisfaction of God’s wrath; Christ bears penalty for sin | One-time transaction that guarantees heaven |
| Role of the Cross | Confronts and defeats Satan’s power | Substitutionary punishment in place of sinners | Payment for sins so believer can go to heaven |
| Role of the Resurrection | Central: victory, new life, empowerment for holiness | Important but secondary: proof of cross’ sufficiency | Often minimized: seen as a future hope more than present power |
| Union with Christ | Participation: believers die and rise with Him (Rom. 6) | Forensic: believers are declared righteous in Him | Conceptual: “I prayed a prayer, so I’m secure” |
| View of Sin | Enslavement, corruption, enemy to be defeated | Guilt, debt that must be paid | Something forgiven already, often downplayed |
| View of Holiness | Essential: freedom leads to transformation and moral responsibility | Secondary: evidence of justification, but not always emphasized | Optional: “grace covers me,” holiness not essential |
| Motivation for Obedience | Grateful participation in Christ’s victory; new identity | Gratitude for forgiveness; fear of dishonoring grace | Weak motivation: heaven guaranteed regardless of conduct |
| Church Culture | Discipleship, ascetic practices, pursuit of virtue | Sermon-centric, focus on doctrine of justification | Pragmatic, consumer-oriented, assurance-driven |
| Moral Outcome | Strong call to holiness, communal accountability, endurance in suffering | Mixed: high emphasis on doctrinal purity, but holiness can be abstracted | Often nominalism, complacency, moral laxity; “cheap grace” |
| Key Scriptures Emphasized | Col. 2:13–15, Rom. 6, 1 Cor. 15, Heb. 2:14–15 | Rom. 3–5, Isa. 53, Heb. 9–10 (legal lens) | John 3:16, Rom. 10:9–10 (isolated) |


✅ Takeaway:

    Christus Victor links salvation directly to moral transformation: you’ve been freed, so live free.

    PSA (Reformed) focuses on legal standing with God: good theology, but can reduce transformation to “fruit” rather than essence.

    Modern Evangelical simplification often collapses salvation into a ticket system, leading to the moral laxity you observed.

Would you like me to also add a “Patristic voices” row (e.g., Irenaeus, Athanasius) under Christus Victor and a “Key Theologians” row (e.g., Calvin, Edwards, Spurgeon for PSA; Finney, modern megachurch for evangelical)? That way you’d see the historical trajectory of influence in one view.

**User:**

I would like for you to add something else.  deliverance and demonic oppression and how these different models viewed these things

**ChatGPT:**

Excellent addition 👌 — because how a tradition views atonement directly affects how it views demonic power, deliverance, and spiritual warfare. The Christus Victor model keeps that front and center, while PSA tends to minimize it, and modern evangelicalism often sidelines it almost entirely.

Here’s the updated table with that row added:
Impact of Atonement Models on Morality, Church Life, and Deliverance

| Category | Christus Victor / Exodus (Early Church) | Penal Substitution / Anselm-Reformed | Modern Evangelical (Ticket to Heaven) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core View of Salvation | Liberation from bondage to sin, death, and Satan; participation in Christ’s victory | Legal satisfaction of God’s wrath; Christ bears penalty for sin | One-time transaction that guarantees heaven |
| Role of the Cross | Confronts and defeats Satan’s power | Substitutionary punishment in place of sinners | Payment for sins so believer can go to heaven |
| Role of the Resurrection | Central: victory, new life, empowerment for holiness | Important but secondary: proof of cross’ sufficiency | Often minimized: seen as a future hope more than present power |
| Union with Christ | Participation: believers die and rise with Him (Rom. 6) | Forensic: believers are declared righteous in Him | Conceptual: “I prayed a prayer, so I’m secure” |
| View of Sin | Enslavement, corruption, enemy to be defeated | Guilt, debt that must be paid | Something forgiven already, often downplayed |
| View of Holiness | Essential: freedom leads to transformation and moral responsibility | Secondary: evidence of justification, but not always emphasized | Optional: “grace covers me,” holiness not essential |
| Motivation for Obedience | Grateful participation in Christ’s victory; new identity | Gratitude for forgiveness; fear of dishonoring grace | Weak motivation: heaven guaranteed regardless of conduct |
| Church Culture | Discipleship, ascetic practices, pursuit of virtue | Sermon-centric, focus on doctrine of justification | Pragmatic, consumer-oriented, assurance-driven |
| Moral Outcome | Strong call to holiness, communal accountability, endurance in suffering | Mixed: high emphasis on doctrinal purity, but holiness can be abstracted | Often nominalism, complacency, moral laxity; “cheap grace” |
| Deliverance & Demonic Oppression | Frontline issue: Christ disarms rulers & powers (Col. 2:15); baptism seen as exorcistic; spiritual warfare central to faith life | Demonic powers acknowledged but subordinated; emphasis on sin as guilt more than demonic bondage; deliverance not central | Often neglected; “spiritual warfare” reduced to moral struggles or prayer formulas; demonic deliverance largely absent or marginalized |
| Key Scriptures Emphasized | Col. 2:13–15, Rom. 6, 1 Cor. 15, Heb. 2:14–15 | Rom. 3–5, Isa. 53, Heb. 9–10 (legal lens) | John 3:16, Rom. 10:9–10 (isolated) |

💡 Key Takeaways

    Early Church / Christus Victor:

        Baptism liturgies often included renunciation of Satan and prayers of exorcism, because salvation was viewed as actual liberation from demonic powers.

        The atonement = Christ breaking the devil’s authority. Deliverance was normal and expected.

    Reformed PSA:

        Spiritual warfare acknowledged (e.g., Puritans wrote about Satan’s temptations), but deliverance ministry wasn’t central.

        The focus shifted to sin’s legal penalty, so Satan became more of an “accuser in court” than an active captor.

    Modern Evangelical “ticket to heaven”:

        Deliverance/demons often pushed to the fringe (or treated as “charismatic excess”).

        Satan is acknowledged doctrinally but rarely addressed practically — spiritual warfare is reduced to temptation and prayer slogans.

👉 So yes, the shift from Christus Victor → PSA → modern evangelical simplification has had a huge effect not only on morality, but also on how the church relates to demonic reality and deliverance ministry.

Do you want me to also layer in quotes from early baptismal liturgies and church fathers (e.g., Tertullian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius) where they explicitly tied baptism/atonement to exorcism and liberation from demons? That would really highlight how different the early church’s mindset was.

**User:**

something i have been interested in is baptismal deliverance.  Are you aware of any writings regarding this?  possibly from closer to the time of christ

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — you’re onto something very important here. Baptismal deliverance (seeing baptism not just as symbolic washing but as an actual act of exorcism/deliverance from Satan’s power) was deeply embedded in the practice of the early church, and in some ways is a direct continuation of the NT itself.

Let me walk you through sources close to the time of Christ (1st–4th centuries):
📜 New Testament Hints

    Romans 6:3–6 – baptism = dying with Christ, being freed from the dominion of sin.

    Colossians 1:13 – “He delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son.”

    1 Peter 3:21 – baptism “now saves you… through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”

    Acts 22:16 – “Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins.”
    → Early Christians saw baptism as an actual transfer of dominion — away from Satan, into Christ.

✍️ Writings Closest to the Apostolic Era
1. The Didache (c. 100 AD)

    One of the earliest Christian manuals on baptism.

    While brief, it assumes baptism is necessary for forgiveness and entrance into the Christian community, aligning with NT deliverance themes.

    Doesn’t explicitly mention exorcism, but it’s implied that baptism = full transition of allegiance.

2. Justin Martyr (c. 150 AD, First Apology 61)

    Describes baptism as illumination and liberation from demons:

        “They are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated… that they may obtain in the water the remission of sins formerly committed.”

        He also says through baptism Christians are delivered from demons who once held them in bondage.

3. Tertullian (c. 200 AD, On Baptism 4–6)

    Very clear: baptism includes an act of renunciation of Satan.

    Quote:

        “When we are about to enter the water, but a little before, in the presence of the congregation, we solemnly profess that we renounce the devil, his pomp, and his angels.”

    This is the earliest explicit witness to the practice of pre-baptismal exorcisms and renunciations.

4. Origen (c. 230 AD, Homilies on Luke)

    Notes that catechumens (those preparing for baptism) underwent exorcisms so that the Holy Spirit could dwell in them without hindrance.

5. Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 350 AD, Catechetical Lectures)

    Provides detailed baptismal instructions.

    Before baptism, candidates had to renounce Satan, spit upon him, and turn to Christ:

        “Do you renounce Satan? … Do you renounce all his works? … Do you renounce all his pomp? … Do you renounce all his service?” (Procatechesis 9)

    This was understood not just as symbolic, but as an actual breaking of demonic bondage.

6. Athanasius (c. 350 AD, On the Incarnation)

    Connects baptismal new life with Christ’s victory over the devil:

        “By the sign of the cross and by baptism, demons are driven out, as if scorched by fire.”

    He explicitly links Christian baptism to deliverance ministry.

🧾 Summary

    NT itself: baptism = transfer of dominion (from Satan to Christ).

    2nd century (Justin, Tertullian): baptism explicitly seen as exorcism + renunciation of Satan.

    3rd–4th century (Origen, Cyril, Athanasius): baptismal rites included formal exorcisms and renunciations, a continuation of the early belief that baptism delivered people from demonic oppression.

✅ Big Picture:
From the time of the apostles onward, baptism was not merely symbolic washing. It was experienced and practiced as a moment of spiritual deliverance — the formal break with Satan’s rule, entry into Christ’s kingdom, and empowerment by the Spirit.

Would you like me to compile the actual baptismal liturgy steps (e.g., the exact renunciations, exorcism prayers, anointings) from these early sources into a kind of “timeline” — so you can see how baptismal deliverance was practiced and evolved from the 1st to 4th centuries?
