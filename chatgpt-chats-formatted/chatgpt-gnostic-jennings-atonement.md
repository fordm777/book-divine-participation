**User:**

What is the view of Jesus according to marcion teachings?   Can you outline and compare verse early church (destroyed works of the devil and free from sin, etc)  reformed theology (psa etc) or modern evangelical vs gnostics vs jennings, or even modern new age christ conscious theology

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely. Let’s break this down carefully. The question is asking for a comparative survey of how Jesus is viewed across a number of theological lenses, from Marcion to early church to modern evangelical and even New Age Christ-consciousness. I’ll outline each clearly and note the main distinctions, emphasizing both theological and textual perspectives.
1. Marcionite View of Jesus (2nd century)

    Key Sources: Marcion’s own writings are lost, but summarized in Tertullian (Adversus Marcionem) and Epiphanius.

    Jesus:

        Seen as entirely distinct from the Jewish God (Yahweh) of the Old Testament.

        Fully divine, not human in the ordinary sense—some sources suggest a docetic view (appeared human but not actually human).

        His mission: reveal the God of love, the “alien God” of the New Testament, contrasting with the “lawgiver” God of the OT.

        Marcion rejected the OT as scripture for Christians; Jesus’ teachings replaced the law.

    Salvation: Delivered by grace alone, through knowledge (gnosis) of the true God.

    Key Verse Emphasis: Luke and Paul’s letters (he heavily edited them). Focus on redemption from the material world.

Contrast with Early Church:

    Early Church: Jesus is both fully God and fully human; came to destroy works of the devil and redeem humanity from sin.

    Marcion: Jesus’ purpose was primarily to reveal knowledge of the loving God, not to fulfill Jewish prophecy or the law.

2. Early Church / Ante-Nicene Fathers

    Jesus:

        Fully human and divine (proto-Chalcedonian understanding).

        Came to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8), redeem from sin, and reconcile humanity to God.

        Incarnation is essential: the Word became flesh to save humanity.

    Salvation: Through faith, baptism, and participation in the life of Christ.

    Key Themes:

        Obedience to God the Father, fulfillment of prophecy, defeat of Satan, sanctification of humanity.

        The material world is not inherently evil; Christ redeems creation, not just the spirit.

Comparison to Marcion:

    Strongly opposed to Marcion’s docetism.

    Affirmed the Old Testament as part of salvation history.

3. Reformed / Modern Evangelical Theology

    Jesus:

        Fully divine and human; sinless life, perfect obedience (cf. Psalm 2, Isaiah 53).

        Substitutionary atonement: died for sins; resurrection demonstrates victory over sin and death.

        High view of scripture: OT and NT form unified revelation.

    Salvation: By grace through faith; Christ’s work is sufficient for redemption.

    Key Verses:

        John 1:1-14 (Word made flesh)

        Romans 5:18-19 (Jesus’ obedience vs. Adam’s)

        Hebrews 2:14-15 (destroyed power of death/evil)

Contrast to Marcion and Gnostics:

    Emphasizes Jesus’ humanity and identification with fallen creation.

    Rejects dualism of good God vs. evil creator God.

4. Gnostic Views (e.g., Valentinus, Basilides)

    Jesus:

        Often purely spiritual, the “Christ” is a divine entity descending to reveal gnosis.

        Human Jesus is sometimes viewed as a mask, vehicle for divine spark; suffering may be illusory.

        Goal: awaken knowledge to escape the material world, not primarily to redeem through crucifixion.

    Salvation: Escaping the material world through knowledge; liberation from ignorance.

Comparison:

    Closer to Marcion in docetism, but more mystical and esoteric.

    Focus on gnosis, not obedience, crucifixion, or resurrection as salvific.

5. Jennings / Liberal Modern Theologians (20th-21st century)

    Jesus:

        Often seen as ethical teacher, exemplar of love and nonviolence.

        Some view Christ as a spiritual archetype rather than divine-human savior.

        Focus on social justice, human transformation, and moral example.

    Salvation: Transformation of character and society rather than metaphysical redemption.

    Comparison:

        Moves away from sin-focused soteriology.

        Less emphasis on miracles or resurrection as historical events.

6. New Age / “Christ Consciousness” Theology

    Jesus:

        Seen as a spiritual master or enlightened being, not necessarily divine in a traditional sense.

        “Christ” is a state of consciousness accessible to all.

        Focus is on inner transformation, enlightenment, and universal love.

    Salvation: Attaining higher consciousness; awakening to one’s own divinity.

    Key Difference:

        Denies historical incarnation and substitutionary atonement.

        Treats Jesus more as spiritual guide than savior.

Comparative Table:

| Tradition | Jesus’ Nature | Mission / Focus | Salvation | Relation to OT | Humanity | Key Distinction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Marcion | Fully divine, docetic | Reveal loving God, grace | Knowledge of God | Rejects OT | Not truly human | Anti-Jewish, dualism |
| Early Church | Fully God and human | Destroy works of devil, redeem sin | Faith, baptism, union with Christ | Integral | Fully human | Incarnation essential |
| Reformed/Evangelical | Fully God and human | Substitutionary atonement | Grace through faith | Integral | Fully human | High view of Scripture, sin focus |
| Gnostics | Spiritual / divine | Reveal gnosis, escape material | Escape ignorance | Often rejected | Apparent only | Dualistic, mystical |
| Jennings / Liberal | Human teacher | Ethical example | Moral transformation | Optional | Human | De-emphasizes miracles/resurrection |
| New Age / Christ Consciousness | Enlightened being | Inner transformation | Attain consciousness | Often irrelevant | Spiritualized | Jesus as archetype, universalist |


If you want, I can draw a visual “Jesus spectrum” showing how each tradition ranges from fully human to fully divine and from material focus to spiritual focus. It really helps make these contrasts crystal clear.

Do you want me to do that?
