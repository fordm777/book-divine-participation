clean animals vs unclean animals and the artery in the neck, what is the difference

**ChatGPT:**

Good question — this touches on both biblical dietary laws and anatomy (specifically how animals are slaughtered and why some are considered “clean” or “unclean”). Let’s look carefully at both aspects.
🕎 1. Clean vs. Unclean Animals — Biblical Overview

In the Hebrew Bible (Torah), especially Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, God divides animals into clean (טָהוֹר, tahor) and unclean (טָמֵא, tamei).
Clean Animals

Animals that could be eaten and used for sacrifice.

    Land animals: Must chew the cud and have a split hoof (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats, deer).

    Sea creatures: Must have fins and scales (e.g., most fish, but not shellfish).

    Birds: Certain species are listed as clean (e.g., dove, quail, pigeon) while birds of prey and scavengers are unclean.

    Insects: Only certain kinds of locusts and grasshoppers are clean.

Unclean Animals

Animals that did not meet those conditions — e.g., pigs (split hoof but do not chew cud), camels, rabbits, shellfish, reptiles, etc.

The distinction was both ritual and health-related, though the exact purpose is interpreted differently by scholars — ritual purity, identity separation from other nations, and possibly prevention of disease.
🩸 2. The Artery in the Neck — Anatomical & Ritual Importance

When slaughtering animals (especially in Jewish and Islamic law), the carotid arteries and jugular veins in the neck are specifically targeted in what’s called shechita (שְׁחִיטָה) in Hebrew or dhabihah (ذَبِيحَة) in Arabic.
Purpose of Cutting the Neck Artery:

    The quick severing of carotid arteries, jugular veins, and trachea/esophagus causes the animal to lose consciousness rapidly.

    Blood drains out quickly — fulfilling the command to not eat blood (Leviticus 17:10–14).

    The spinal cord is not cut, ensuring blood pumps out naturally through the heart.

Why This Matters:

    For clean animals, the method of death and draining of blood is crucial.

    Even a clean animal (like a cow or lamb) becomes unclean for consumption if:

        It dies naturally or is killed improperly (not properly bled).

        The blood remains in the meat.

    Blood represents life (“the life is in the blood,” Lev. 17:11), and consuming it symbolically meant taking life in a way that violated God’s sanctity laws.

⚖️ 3. Relationship Between Clean/Unclean and the Neck Artery

| Aspect | Clean Animals | Unclean Animals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eligibility for Eating | Permitted if slaughtered properly (cutting arteries in neck to drain blood) | Never permitted regardless of how killed |
| Reason for Neck Artery Cut | To remove blood and kill humanely in accordance with law | Does not apply — they are forbidden regardless |
| Symbolic Meaning | Respect for life and obedience to divine law | Representation of impurity, corruption, or symbolic uncleanness |

💡 Summary

    Clean animals can be eaten only if their blood is drained, which is achieved by cutting the arteries and veins in the neck.

    Unclean animals are forbidden no matter how they’re slaughtered.

    The artery in the neck is central because it’s the quickest, most humane way to bleed the animal completely — fulfilling the biblical law against consuming blood.

    The distinction between clean and unclean animals reflects both ritual holiness and a respect for the sanctity of life.

Would you like me to include how these concepts carry into Christian or Islamic interpretations (e.g., Acts 15 or halal laws)?

**User:**

you are missing my question, I am asking about how the arteries are different

**ChatGPT:**

Ah — got it. You’re asking not about ritual slaughter, but about how the arteries themselves differ between clean and unclean animals — anatomically. Excellent and quite deep question.

Let’s go straight into the biological and anatomical differences, as this is a fascinating area where physiology and the biblical categories sometimes align in interesting ways.
🩸 1. The Arteries in the Neck — Overview

All mammals and birds have similar major blood vessels in the neck:

    Carotid arteries – carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the brain.

    Jugular veins – return deoxygenated blood from the brain to the heart.

However, how these arteries are arranged, how accessible they are, and how blood flow to the brain is maintained (or stopped) varies significantly between animal types — and that turns out to be key.
🐄 2. Clean Animals (e.g., Cow, Sheep, Goat, Deer)

In clean animals (the ruminants with split hooves), the carotid arteries run superficially in the neck — right under the surface — making them easily severed by a cut to the throat.

Anatomical characteristics:

    Carotids are large and superficial → easy to reach.

    Blood pressure is high, and when severed, the brain is deprived of blood instantly, causing rapid loss of consciousness.

    There are no significant collateral vessels (alternative routes) supplying the brain once the carotids are cut.

    Therefore, a neck cut is humane and effective — the animal loses consciousness quickly and blood drains efficiently.

✅ Summary (Clean Animals)

    Easy to bleed out completely.

    Quick loss of consciousness.

    Efficient removal of blood from the body.

🐖 3. Unclean Animals (e.g., Pig, Camel, Horse, Dog)

In many unclean animals, the carotid arteries are deeper, protected, or branch differently, and the brain can receive blood from other sources even if the neck arteries are cut.

Key differences:

    Carotid arteries are buried deep in muscular tissue or shielded by bone or cartilage.

    In some, carotids branch before reaching the neck, forming rete mirabile (“wonderful net”) — a network at the base of the skull that maintains blood flow to the brain even after the neck is cut.

    This means the animal remains conscious longer and bleeds less efficiently.

    These characteristics make such a cut ineffective or inhumane as a means of quick death and complete blood removal.

Examples:

| Animal | Clean? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cow / Sheep / Goat | ✅ Clean | Carotid arteries accessible; rapid bleeding and unconsciousness |
| Pig | ❌ Unclean | Carotids buried; brain supplied by alternative arteries; doesn’t bleed out easily |
| Camel | ❌ Unclean | Complex rete mirabile system; slower loss of consciousness |
| Horse | ❌ Unclean | Carotids deep; bleeding inefficient; retains brain perfusion longer |

🧠 4. The Rete Mirabile and Its Significance

The rete mirabile (Latin: “wonderful net”) is a vascular network found in several unclean species (pigs, camels, horses, cats, etc.), but notably absent in the clean ruminants like cattle, sheep, and goats.

This network:

    Sits at the base of the brain.

    Receives blood from several smaller arteries (not just the carotids).

    Continues to perfuse the brain even if the neck arteries are cut — meaning the animal stays conscious longer.

    Prevents rapid bleeding from the neck.

This has been cited by some Jewish and Islamic scholars and veterinarians as a biological reason that certain animals are unsuitable for the biblically prescribed slaughter — they don’t lose consciousness or bleed properly when the throat is cut.
⚖️ 5. Summary Table

| Feature | Clean Animals (Cow, Sheep, Goat) | Unclean Animals (Pig, Camel, Horse, Dog) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carotid artery position | Superficial and accessible | Deep and protected |
| Collateral brain blood supply | Minimal (no rete mirabile) | Extensive (rete mirabile present) |
| Result of neck cut | Instant brain ischemia and unconsciousness | Slower or incomplete brain ischemia |
| Bleeding efficiency | Rapid and complete | Slower, less complete |
| Anatomical design | Suited for shechita/dhabihah | Not suited for neck bleeding method |

🧬 6. Summary Thought

So to directly answer your question:

    How are the arteries in the neck different between clean and unclean animals?

➡️ Clean animals have superficial, easily accessible carotid arteries with no collateral brain circulation — so a neck cut causes rapid loss of consciousness and efficient blood loss.
➡️ Unclean animals have deeply buried or branched arteries with rete mirabile systems supplying the brain — so a neck cut does not fully stop blood flow to the brain or drain the blood effectively.

This difference is anatomical, functional, and remarkably consistent with the animals classified as clean and unclean in the Torah.

Would you like me to include diagrams showing the arterial layout differences (so you can visualize the rete mirabile vs direct carotid path)?
